  	        Well, everyone got up and going this morning.  It's still raining, but that's okay with me.  Sort of suits my mood.  I could easily have stayed home in bed with my book and the cats.  This has been a lot of rain though!  People have wet basements, there are lakes where there should be golf courses and fields, everything is green, green, green.  But, it is supposed to be 26 degrees by Friday, so we'll be dealing with mosquitos next week.  I heard Winnipeg described as an "Old Testament" city on  urlLink CBC Radio One  last week and it sort of rings true.  Floods, infestations, etc., etc..               	        My four-year old never stops talking.  She'll say "Mom?" and when I say "Yes?", she'll say "Ummm.... ummm... oh yeah.  Where do lady bugs hide in the rain?"  Anything to hear her own voice. Very, very exhausting.    Now I remember!  This is why I go to work!   *Sigh*               	        Actually it's not raining yet, but I bought 15 tickets to the  urlLink Goldeyes  game for my Mom's birthday tonight, and it is supposed to rain.  Do they cancel baseball games because of rain?  Although the ballpark is beautiful, it ain't the  urlLink SkyDome .  We used to go to the Jays games occassionally when we lived in Toronto and really like taking the kids to the Goldeyes games now.  I don't know what  urlLink Blue Jays  tickets cost now, but I'm sure it's cheaper here in Winnipeg.  Oh, I just checked and it  definitely  is!               	        Ha! Just set up my RSS feed - that is so easy!  Why doesn't everyone do it?  Enough for today.  The sun is shining and I should be outside planting my poor flowers (that have spent far too long in their pots) but I have 3 kindergartners and a preschooler who are refusing to go outside.  Little gameboy junkies...  I should talk!  Last post today, I promise.               	        Oh, which just reminded me, we were talking about canning food at coffee break this morning.  Is this becoming a lost art?  Are there any people under 40 who know how to do this?  Those of us at coffee that fall in that age range couldn't.  What would happen if the world as we know it ceased to exist (a la  urlLink Day After Tomorrow  which is only being released today and I can't wait to see - I love a good escapist picture with lots of special effects) and we had to preserve our food somehow?  Well, we in Canada definitely would need to preserve our food.  I found lots of sites on canning, including  urlLink this one , but I guess that wouldn't help me much if everything went. Better print it out and keep it just in case!               	        I've tried starting blog after blog and it just never feels right.  Then I read today that it feels strange to most people, but the more you do it the better it gets (hmm, sounds suspiciously like something else!) so I decided to give it another try.    My husband bought me a notepad at  urlLink McNally  (the best bookstore in Western Canada) with that title and a picture of a 50s housewife grinning desperately.  Each page has something funny like "New curtains!  Hurrah!".  For some reason it struck me as absolutely hilarious and has stuck in my head ever since.  What were those women thinking?               	        My 20th high school  urlLink reunion  is this weekend.  There are over 100 people coming, so it should be a good time.  Lots of names from the past.  Funny, I barely ever run into anyone, and yet a lot are still in the city.               	        We always have pizza on Friday nights.  It takes the stress out of "what am I going to make for dinner" and the kids look forward to it.  In fact, many of their friends look forward to it too!  But tonight we are having a family gathering at my mom's and I've offered to make pizza for all the kids.  So I've been madly making dough in my breadmaker (which is very easy but still needs to be done) and freezing it.  Now I have to go home and cut vegetables for the vegetarian cousins' pizzas and grate a huge amount of cheese.  Then I'll have to cart it all over to my mom's without wrecking the crusts.   It is not the usual relaxing Friday night, but this hasn't been a relaxed week at all.               	        Okay, I saw it this past weekend.  Not as good as Independence Day for sure.  Better than Raising Helen which I also saw.  Yes, two movies in one weekend!  One was with book club, and one was with my husband since we hadn't been out together forever.  Guess which was with whom...               	        I've been cataloguing film scripts at work.  What fun!  I have to look a lot of the writers up on the  urlLink IMDB .  What a great database!  I read somewhere that there were lots of mistakes in there, but given the absolutely huge amount of information, it is bound to happen.  And everything links!  I love it.  Library catalogues should be so good.    Best of all is getting a little sneak peek into people's lives.  Just enough to get your imagination going...               	        Paul Martin promised today that if he is elected he will create 250,000 new affordable child care spaces.  I think they promised something like that last time around too.  But if they really want to do something for working women, they should make it easier for women to work and be with their families.  An affordable child care space would be helpful, but I want to spend more time with my children, so I need more flexible working arrangements.  Instead of a year's maternity leave, what if they made it mandatory for employers to allow women five years of part-time work.  If we worked at least 50% they should have to hold our jobs for us.  I think that would appeal to a lot of moms.  And then there would be a lot of part-time child care spaces too, which are  impossible  to find right now.    Yes, I'm still pondering quitting my job.  It seems to me to be ineveitable now... just a question of when.               	        No, I still haven't seen it, but apparently it is  urlLink not so good   unless  you are a librarian.  Ha!  I am!               	        Well, it's over!  It was good to see so many people.  Most haven't changed much, but some have changed a great deal.  Funny how things that were important in high school no longer are.    Anyway, it is over and I'm glad.  I was very, very tired all week and am glad that I had 4 days off to snooze a bit.                              The astute among you will note that this run is a minute shorter than the 5th one.  This run was three minutes running, one minute walking--which is much harder than the previous run-walk ratio.  I was feeling good until the 4th repetition, which was difficult, and I really struggled through the 5th one.  Tonight I noticed a very odd sensation.  While I was happy to take the little walking breaks, I found that the moment I started running again after each break my legs felt really invigorated.  I'm sure there's some clever scientific name for this phenomenon.  However, I'm also sure there's  no  clever scientific name for the fact that I'm really, really glad tonight's run is over.                              So the pressing question was whether I should increase my total running time or decrease my walking time.  Since the schedule I'm following says to increase running time, I decided to do that.  They're the experts, after all--I'm just the one in the expensive shoes.  While today didn't exactly feel what I would call "good," it didn't feel bad either.  Actually, after my third repetition I felt like a million bucks; after my fourth, I flagged a bit.  But I made it through to my 7th repetition without feeling like my lungs were inside out.  I probably could have done 8 repetitions, if the truth be told, but I'm sure I'll regret saying that on Wednesday.  Jon has just decided to go on a health kick too; he says that he's going to join me in running.  I think I might be a little bit too slow for him.  Today I definitely felt like a jogger rather than a runner--I think it has to do with the massive amount of crap (chocolate syrup, ice cream, crisps, pizza, etc.) I've been eating over the past couple of days.                              I can assure you that it was not laughably easy.  It wasn't as hard as last time, but it still felt pretty painful.  I didn't start thinking I was going. to. die. until the 4th repetition, at which point I again told myself that I was only going to do 5 repetitions.  I even had all sorts of excuses figured out: I was running at midday in the sun; I was running in the park on uneven ground, I was feeling vaguely hung-over.  But in the end it was the thought of coming here and writing down the fact that I had wussed out that made me do the 6th repetition.  Now I have the reward of a hot bath.                              Tonight I decided to decrease the walking time between the periods of running.  I did 2 minutes on, one minute off, repeated 6 times.  After the first 2 repetitions, I felt like I was going. to. die.  But the middle two were fine; I was on top of the world.  I considered only doing 5 repetitions, but when I finished the 5th, I was further away from my house than I expected, so I slogged on to a 6th.  The 6th repetition was a real struggle.  I was literally forcing myself to put one foot in front of the other.  The knowledge of a hot bath was the only thing that kept me going.  Then I had to run past my house to finish out the time.  Psychologically, I found that upsetting.  I also find the people on the sidewalks upsetting.  I have this paranoid fantasy that all people who see me running are runners themselves, and they're critiquing me.  When I'm feeling slow and down, I find that forcing myself into a sprint helps me get past it.  Even though I'm not a fast runner by any means, I prefer to run at speed rather than to jog.  I'm not sure if this was a struggle because I didn't run for over a week, or if it was because it was genuinely more difficult than my last run.  Anyway, I'm sure I'll laugh at myself on Saturday when I go out and do the same run again and I find it laughably easy.                              I spent a long weekend in Edinburgh, doing more walking around than usual, but not doing any running.  In the meantime, however, my knee felt fantastic.  After the ACL surgery I lost most of my muscle tone, which meant that my kneecap wasn't tracking properly, which led to some clicking and aching when walking, especially when walking down steps.  Now, after only two runs, I can feel a real difference in the way my knee feels when going down stairs.  It's almost normal, which is something I don't take for granted.                              Tonight I did the 2 minutes running, 2 minutes walking deal (repeated 4 times), which is the recommended first run for 10 training according to the schedule I've decided to use.  I have to admit that it was far too easy.  I came in the house having not even broken a sweat.  Because it was so easy, I'm not sure whether to increase the overall time out or decrease the in-between walking times.  There seem to be definite advantages and disadvantages to both.                              My initial plan was to start on a basic 10k training schedule,  urlLink as described here .  However, tonight--my first night out--was still a little bit of a tester, so I ran for 1 minute, walked for 1 minute, and repeated that 6 times.  It was reasonably hard work, but it wasn't anything scary, and my knee felt fine.  I feel that I am ready to move onto the proper 10k training schedule.                              Whoever reads this (if there is anyone) might think I'm not taking this running thing very seriously.  I am, believe me, but you have to understand that the past few weeks and the next few weeks are full up.  There are plenty of nights where I get 5 hours of sleep because I'm busy doing things I must do (and there's precious little reading or watching TV going on), then the next day I'm shattered because I only got 5 hours of sleep.  Fitting in half an hour of running, while technically feasible, is not always an incredibly attractive option.  Cycling, however, is a happy medium.  But I have been afraid to cycle recently for two reasons:  1) Last October, running + cycling really made my knee hurt.  Running was ok, but cycling actually caused my knee to react so badly that I couldn't run anymore.  2) My chain is rusty.  I've been running (if you can call it that) for a few weeks with no bad reaction from my knee at all, so I thought tonight I would give cycling a go.  On closer inspection my chain wasn't too bad (though I probably should replace it), so I braved it.  Because I haven't cycled in a while and I was worried that either my knee or my chain would break, I didn't go too far afield, and only did half an hour.  It's not particularly hard work for me, even on the hardest gears, and it's an excellent opportunity to make my left leg work harder (because I would estimate that my left leg is only about 80% as strong as my right leg now).  We shall see how my knee reacts, but I'll probably be cycling more if it's ok.                              I'm amazed that, even being so lazy as to go out only once a week for the past couple of weeks, I've managed to improve each week.  Today I ran for 7 minutes, walked for 2, ran for 4, walked for 2, and ran for 7.  That's what 7 (2) 4 (2) 7 means in the subject line.  I think that makes more sense than trying to reckon up the fraction each time.  I mean, really.  What was I thinking?  So tonight was eventful.  I didn't mention it in my last post, but last week someone actually  stopped me to ask for directions  while I was running--while there were  other people  around.  I wrote it off to the absurdity that is present in everyday society, but today, as I ran towards an elderly man who was carrying his dog, he asked me, "Are you jogging?"  Of course I am!  Do I look like I'm, for example, fishing?  Could the direction-asker and the elderly man really not tell?  Do I just look like I'm going for a leisurely stroll?  Then, as I was running along on the sidewalk next to the park, a snivelling brat kicked his football at me, hard.  I don't think he appreciated it when I called him a "little prick."  But he was.  I hope he falls out of a tree and breaks his ankle in three places.  I now have comments, so if you feel the need to tell me what a heartless, child-hating bitch I am, please feel free.  I like these new Blogger templates; they're pretty.                              I know, it was a week.  I am trying.  ("You can say that again, ha ha!")  (Ahh, do you see what I did there?: I used the word "trying" as a verb, and then pretended that someone else implied that it was used as an adjective.  Ahhhh!)  Anyway, so when I went out, I said to myself, "Self, why not just run until you really feel like you have to stop, instead of adhering rigidly to this schedule?"  So I did.  And I ran for 6 minutes.  Now, I wasn't really all that tired after 6 minutes (compared to the last 6 minutes I did, anyway).  It's not my legs that complain, and I don't get cramps in my sides or anything.  The main problem that makes me have to stop is my chest/lungs aching.  I've always been this way and thought it was normal, but  urlLink this page says it's not .  Hmmm.  So I had to walk for 2 minutes until my lungs stopped aching, then I did 4 minutes running again, then 2 minutes walking, then the final 6 minutes running.  If you're thinking that a full 20 minutes of running shouldn't be that hard to achieve, remember that I've been totally,  totally  inactive for a year.                              I think that running is akin to childbirth in some respects (not that I've ever given birth): while you're doing it, it's painful and terrible and you can't imagine ever doing it again, not in a million years, and you curse the bastard that got you into it in the first place (in running's case, yourself).  But then it's over, and you have a shower, and you sit down to blog about it, and it feels great.  Running, that is.  My analogy ended in the first paragraph.  You weren't still trying to make it work for this one, were you?  Anyway, I didn't do myself any favors by not running for nearly a week.  In case you're curious, a combination of factors including illness, DIY-mania, and heavy rain contributed to my sloth.  Tonight I went out thinking, "Do I really have to bother with the run-walk nonsense?  Can't I just run out for 10 minutes, then run back for 10 minutes?"  The answer is no.  I did the same run as before, and by the end of the second repetition I looked over at my house (which faces the park) and seriously considered running home right then, jumping the fence, and going in the back door.  Then I remembered that my back door was locked (safety first, kids!) and that in order to get home I'd have to go back the way I came, round the corner, and down the road again.  And by the time I thought of all the logistics, my repetition was over.  Later, something funny happened on my 4th repetition: I started running, and suddenly the 3 minutes was over, just like that.  I thought I must have shortchanged myself or read my watch wrong, but no: it just went like a hot knife through butter.  Mmmm, butter.  Ahh, that's the other thing.  I haven't had much food today, which might have contributed to my near crash early in the run.  I tried to eat a toasted bacon and guacamole sandwich for lunch, but someone really needs to tell the ladies in the canteen that guacamole should only be served ice cold.  Hot guacamole is nastified.  Oh well, at least there were pink wafers in the tea room.                              I haven't just dropped off the face of the earth.  I went on holiday to the US, where it would be almost rude to exercise.  I'm back now, and as soon as I'm over my jetlag I'll be back in the saddle/running shoes.

From College Humor   Tennagers guide to picking a AIM screen name  Whether you're sending e-mails or chatting with friends, an essential to using the internet is having a screen name that tells people who you are. Here are some suggestions to help you pick out an awesome name!   AE or AF - Use these acronyms for American Eagle and Abercrombie and Fitch. This will show people that you have rich parents and therefore, you are rich as well. And everyone knows that if you are rich and wear Abercrombie and Fitch, then you are very attractive.   Examples: AE_girl04, AF_snowboard19   420 - Putting 420 after a screen name will show people that you are rebellious and are cool because you do drugs. They won't ever mess with you, and girls will flock to you because you are bad.   Examples: Sublimegirl420, sk8er420   69 - This shows that you obviously have sex, A LOT. Others that see this will want to have sex with you because you know all about it.   Examples: Sexystud69, badazz6969   666 - Use this to scare away people. They will see how mighty and evil you are, and they will fallback in fear.   Examples: Death666, NeoMatrix666  "chic" - Guys are very attracted to girls who but "chic" somewhere in their screen name. This shows you are hot and want to have a boyfriend who likes to play computer games all day and collect Star Wars toys.   Example: tightchic13f, cute_chic02   "sexy" - Guys go crazy when you put on this screen name. It says "I'm a really attractive girl that wants to have sex with a guy I meet online." You can be uglier than Chelsea Clinton, but with this on your SN, you'll come across as Brittany Spears.   Examples: Sexy18f, Sexyskatergirl   "gurl" - Using "gurl" in your screen name shows that you are the cute girl that lives next door type. It makes you sound very nice, but also a target of weird 40-year old sexual predators.   Examples: fun_gurl_2003, pony_gurl82   "horny" - This shows that you are a 40-year old sexual predator that wants to find a young boy or girl to lure in and abduct at the local mall.   Examples: Horny_babe_696969, Horny4u                                           Well it didn't rain like Clingerman said it did, so i'm gonna go see if people are playing out at Tabor, hopefully so, but i doubt it.   I am DEFINATELY finishing my chem project today then i'm set to start my around the world paper. Wow I hate school.                                        Yeah that new Pic Squad CD is very good, listen to number 6, 9, and 15. 6 Is easily the best. Got the teacher recomendations, got pretty much everything i want but 2 ap's and physics is gonna be tough if i'm working (which i most definately will)                                         Tennis tryouts started, i doubt I'll make it, I got pounded today by some freshman                                        Well looks like 10 people are getting cut from the tennis team this year, hope i'm not one of them, but if i am I'll just go get a job.                                         1 Hour delays are cool, unless you still have to do like 15 chemistry practice problems. Oh well looks like i'll be in the library again during newspaper. Very close to finishing my chemistry project though, so that is good, but then i got to get started on Around the World.                                         Ok, listem to Laney Pope today she might have something accurate to say, on account of the snow falling from the sky.                                           Still working on the chemistry project, not that hard but still takes a long time (8 pages)   I got $20 and a pocket knife for valentines. Funny i didn't know that violent weapons were a customary gift on valentines day, but I'm not complaining.                                         Like I said, don't count on snow.......stupid Laney Pope.   Well back to writing a research paper on Enology.                                           Hopefully there will be no school tomorrow but i wouldn't count on it, last time WXII said 100% chance of snow we got nothing.   Well i got to go work on this Chemistry paper so i can have time to watch the OC.                                         Writing tests are retarded.......  Along with chemistry projects and most importantly projects that force you to travel around the world in 80 days.   Other Things that are retarded include....  People that steal candy bars Dramatic People languages other than English The Perfect Score  Things that are not retarded include.....  The OC Splinter Cell Mt. Tabor gangs War Movies Fight Clubs The Boondock Saints Coldplay                                         Ok nothing happened that was crazy, except I chipped a back tooth, oh and I actually figured out what we are doing in math.   So you know who is the man, Chen, the president of Taiwan. That guy faked an assassination so he could win an election. Now I don't know about you but that shows dedication. I mean if Bush or Kerry took a bullet for their job, I would support them. Holla.                                        So Daniel who do you want to win the election? I get that question alot, ok maybe not but stay with me here.  Basically I when I was a young and ignorant youth I liked Bush, yeah ok he had a pretty good start, he handled September 11th pretty well, but the economy is pretty bad now a days and this whole WMD thing really is starting to make me question our reason for war (not saying that going into Iraq was bad.) I don't think that he will win the election but I wouldn't be surprised if Bush "happens" to find Bin Laden around about September or October, to seal the deal election, but right now it looks like he is in an uphill battle.   Kerry on the other hand seems to have alot more expierience and I like that his is not so much of a cowboy when it comes to foreign policy (not that I really care/know about foreign policy)                                        I finally got around to seeing The Passion of the Christ. It is a well done movie and i think is gonna go on my list of movies you need to see before you die.                                         My chemistry teacher must think it is funny to make me stress this much, I mean she gives me all this crap to do today, I mean it was due today and everything but still....the nerve.                                        Well I'm finally back from camping and all I can say is "don't ever let Will Bullins handel a gun" he is quite the shot. Now I got to go do my project for spanish.                                        I'm gonna be gone for the weekend, that I why I'm going on a posting rampage, and because I've had nothing to do all day.                                         I am finally done with my costume for my around the world in 80 days project. I'm gonna go celebrate by working on another project.                                         Many of you may have seen that my brother hacked my blog and changed my pictre to one of richard dean anderson, or McGuyver. Please disreguard any of this stuff.                                        Well my Blog has had a face life. Now there is a retarded picture of me, i could make a better one but I'm just way too lazy.                                         I've been totally bogged down in H/W this week and thanks to Mr. Mecham I have to do a project this weekend also. Ugh oh how I loath large armed spanish teachers.                                        Yeah i'm going camping this weekend. Its gonna be not fun/fun. Not fun because the stuff we're doing is gonna be boring until we go shooting wich with be fun.                                         I found out I got an A in Chemistry, how cool is that. Another cool thing is that I am about to be done with my Around the World in Eighty Days project, speaking of that I got to go work on it.                                          Way to go Sean May, you alone drew 3 fouls in 30 seconds. General Failure.   Back to my life:  Me and Will both agree that if your invited to the Prom by someone you should be greatful and nice about it. Because if your not we're gonna break your knee cap(s) and slap you. Oh and don't worry if your not greatful you'll be spending most of your night at home anyway, that is if you can keep your date. I'm not going to Prom so this really doesn't pertain to me, but I still find it comial the way some people act.                                         Christine got in a car wreck, she is ok though but it was crazy. Will and I went to her house, it was fun we just chilled really.  Go Heels                                        my dad got a new car (Camry XLE) so i get the 98 Accord, holla.                                         I made a 104 on my math test, now i just can't screw up on my test friday and I am FREE AT LAST!                                        Well i realized I'm not cool like other bloggers becuase I don't post about "meaningful" stuff. Well too bad, they can deal with it. Anyway, looks like the message board it dying, but oh well.   My b-day is coming up but i don't get my liscense till april (hopefully, depending on my grades and such)                                          Well basketball seasons over, our team lost to first pres in the simi finals, but we put up a valiant effort and i had a pretty good game. I'm tired now, i'm going to bed.                                         I'm sorry but the person who wrote the article they are talking about in this article (sorry if that sounds confusing) is a general failure at everything. They say that Pat Tillman was not a hero, just an idiot. I don't care if your a democrat or a republican you should support your country and those who die for you to live in it. Pat Tillman gave up a job which made him millions so that he could fight for the freedom of you and me. So to the author of that article i have just this to say to you.... Get a life you waste of space.    urlLink SI.com - NFL - UMass president criticizes student's column on felled soldier - Thursday April 29, 2004 2:13PM                                          urlLink Schoolzone not metaphors   my favorite is "He was as tall as a six-foot-three-inch tree."

That is all.                                         The apprentice is the greatest show ever. I mean who would have thought that desk jobs could be so cool. Essentially the show is water cooler drama at its finest.                                         I being the 16 year old that i am have already had my 15 minutes of fame. It all started when I was on a family trip to NYC, 1 month after 9/11. My family and I decided to take a trip to NBC and tour the studios. The tour was great but once we got out we saw on the news ticker "NBC Employee has anthrax."  Mom: "Oh that's just lovely"   Well we get out and are about to walk away from the scene when my dad who was alread tired began to pass out (we later found out it was also from the blood pressure medicine that he takes) Ok so i'm flipping out and the media think that I am a complete retard that thinks he has anthrax (not to say that there wern't people like that in the crowd)  3 days later i arrive back in NC, and one of my best friend's sister (who was my bro's friend) calls and asks if we were in NYC that week, he says yes and she told us that her mom was in Canada and I had made the front page of the Globe and Mail, one of the largest newspapers in Canada, (The picture was huge too)   Don't believe me, check out this search of gettyimages.com   http://editorial.gettyimages.com/source/CFW/imageResults.aspx?s=ImagesAdvancedSearchState|2|15||0||1|||||0|0|0|| 0|Justin+Sullivan|7|anthrax|513023||0  I am the last row, middle picture. Oh and just incase your wondering, i have that newspaper still.                                         I have to go take my liscense test soon, but I'm not sure when. You wouldn't believe how nervous I am, probably because I hit a car in "in-car" so I kind of want to redeem myself. But if I do well I'll hopefully have my liscense soon.                                           Yeah looks like I'm gonna be the master of ceremonies for the fashion show on day eighty. I guess that is cool, but there are gonna be a ton of people there.  So who is this cool cat that is telling all the Shiites (sp?) to kill Americans in Iraq. Regardless of the backlash I think that the US needs to take that cool guy down.                                         Isn't my blog in spanish awesome    urlLink Translated version of http://catchyname.blogspot.com/                                         I got splinter cell: Pandora Tomorrow, and I must say it is stunning, and the online is awesome also.                                         So Summer is finally here. This means that I start work next wednesday and that I am actaully gonna be raking in some dough. Word Up.                                         So i have 3 more exams to go. So far I'm doing pretty well, and I even made 2 bucks playing poker at Brad's this afternoon. It was quite fun I must say.                                         Gotta give props to Hank Wirth for finding this gem.    urlLink Apple - Trailers - Lost Boys of Sudan                                         So as another year passes I feel like I have learned a plethora of new information about life and about myself, so I thought I would share some of it:  I can become excruciatingly annoying jobs are hard to come by xbox's are not meant to be dropped onto the pavement do not sit near Alex pento when he has a full bottle of gatorade  The OC rocks true playas rock the Daniel herring look (collard shirt, pot head haircut, cargo shorts) poker is a great way to lose money la caretta is rater good drivers tests are way to easy to stress over the holocaust was bad, but you get tired of it REALLY fast gandalf will not help you get out of the boat (I'm not a LOTR freak, I just hallucinate) delux 247 is real                                          So I walk into third lunch and Alex is in his normal "hey there is a group of people, lets make fun of Daniel" mood. I sit down, don't really say anything and Alex decideds it would be funny if we got a black guy that could literally annihilate me, but I thought he really wasn't gonna act on it, that was until John Kincaid opened his mouth.   John: Hey Jeremy come over here"  Jeremy (black guy):what up  Neal: This kid (pointing at me) was talking trash about you  Jeremy: WHAT?  Daniel: Oh S#!T  Jeremy: What did he say?  Daniel: I didn't say anything, I don't even know you.    We go back and fourth trying to decide if i said anyting, until Adam Kincaid opens his mouth   Adam: He called you a N@#$%R!  Jeremy: You called me what?  Daniel: I swear I didn't  Jeremy: Hey Corey come over here   This is where I actually get a break, I have known Corey since I was in 9th and I wrote and article about him this year   Corey: Nah I know Daniel he wouldn't say that.   Daniel: Thank you Jesus  So after that I go into the lunch line and look over and see this Jeremy guy make a cut throat sign to me, which yet again made me think I was going to die. But I was pretty sure he was kidding with me.

But unfortunately i now must go to school.                                         So Blogger FINALLY Added some new templates.   In other news, I think I finally got a job at Arbor Acres, washing dishes for $7.50/hour.                                        So I just got to thinking if Dave Chappelle had a show about Mount Tabor it would probably look something like this:  1st Skit: World Series of Pat (For the black people, and Nick Jennings) 2nd Skit: World Series of Texas Hold'em Poker (for the white people) Skits 3-7:Mrs. Baily, an in depth look 8th Skit: Tyrone Biggums visits Tabor, gives up crack, starts smoking weed 9th Skit: Mr. Baily replaces Lil' John in his signature skits 10th Skit: Tyrone Biggums visits Reynolds and becomes an alcoholic 11th skit: Wayne Brady comes and is overwhelmed by all the whiteness.                                         Well, i really haven't been that vocal on my feelings about the election, i have stated that I support Kerry but I have realized that politics are best left for the class room not a friendly setting such as poker or eating out. So basically I don't really like bush but i really don't like Michael Moore. This guy made Farenheit 9/11 and he is a totaly jerk, essentailly he made it to get out the anti-bush vote, not to really look at the facts. Head on over to www.moorewatch.com and check out what they have to say.    Please note I am planning on going to go see this movie and will report back about what I saw.   Ok so thats it, oh i go the court date on tuesday, gonna be crazy down at city hall when D nasty gets in the defendents chair.                                         Unlike 90% of my friends, I am not in Daytona so i will be here all week not doing much until thursday.                                         So while all most of my friends are in Daytona Beach I am here, not doing anything because the people at work gave me 3 consecutive days off starting Monday which sucks cause i really wanted some hours.                                        So I started work last week, its ok, I mean I'm getting payed 7.50/hr to serve people food, and usually I can leave an hour early if I want. 21 days till my court date, that means I have 3 weeks to acquire 150 bucks. That shouldn't be too hard.                                         So I got a speeding ticket saturday, 18 over on shatalon (that is a 63 in a 45) but it looks like i'm not gonna need to get a lawyer. Apparently in Forsyth county they are leanient on first time speeding offenders, so all i'm gonnna have to do is take Alive at 25 class and then pay a fine, but it won't go on my insurance and is whiped from my record.

You are attracted to those who are warm and obedience.  2.  In the process of courtship, the approach that would make you     feel irresistable is creative, never let you feel bored.  3.  The impression you would like to give to your lover is loyal,     faithful, never change.  4.  You don't like it when your partner is emotional and/or too     moody; and you don't know how to please him/her.  5.  The kind of relationship you would like to build with your     partner is one that you care not only about the present but     also the future with your partner, a long-lasting relationship     that you can grow with.  6.  You care about the society and morality, you won't do anything     wrong after marriage.  7.  You think of marriage as a precious thing.

NgelasTiger: because its INTESTTINTS!!!                             wow, i just skimmed at what we wrote. hahahaha. so young. i mean somethings i totally remember. and others... are so surprising because i really forgot. hahah.                              took hours to recover this blog. hahah. amazingly, its still here                      Hello hello hello again. It's lovely to speak to you all. Really. Let's see... seeing as my mother is off at work for another 40 million hours and I have neither A) a license or B) a car (though I have a permit and could easily drive anywhere I wanted to had I my Jeep), I am inherently under house arrest.  'Oh,' you say, 'But it's such a lovely day outside! Why don't you take the dog for a walk, or go for a bike ride, or read a book in the sun?' Well, first off, I will not be taking anyone for a walk because I am just now regaining said gift of movement back myself. Yes, I have begun training for cross country, and it  hurts . Secondly, my dog is quite content to nap, and continue on in a napping way until about 6 o'clock when he will undoubtedly begin to go mad with hunger. Yes, I starve my dog. He never eats. He is bone thin, and can barely survive on the bits and scraps from the garbage left over from the feast last night.  Actually, he is getting rather portly.  We feed him the same two meals a day, it's just that he hasn't gone for any walkies in a bit. I should go throw the ball for him outside. But not now, he's napping. And besides, that much physical exertion after a long and strenuous day of, err, doing stuff, might just kill me. And I have practice tomorrow. Need to preserve my energy, I do. Of course, the scheduled practice was to go swimming. Well, coach calls it swimming, it's really treading water for forty minutes. But it  is  much more fun than drills and sprints, or even a long run. No, though. We can't go swimming. The swimmers are going swimming. Wait a bit, it's not even the swim team. It's... the children! Little children who are afraid of the water and cling to their mother's legs before getting thrown into their cold, wet, doom, only to be met by some overly-perky girl with a long blonde ponytail, enthusiastically encouraging the little kids who are innocently flailing their arms about to "relax... be one with the water... and blow little bubbles... and..." So, while some children will become forever aqua-phobic, I and my fellow cross country runners will succumb to the pain and torture that is... the DP weight room. Again, actually not as bad as some workouts. It's just that, well, we did it on Tuesday. And it hurt. A lot. And it smells. A lot. And swimming is just way more fun. Ah well. C'est la vie.  Friday's workout is going to kill me. Sprints. I hate sprints. Sprints are the reason (besides wanting to devote my precious time to the beautiful art that is theatre) I quit track. And not only are we doing sprints, oh no, we are doing sprints  on the BEACH!  Ooh, it just keeps getting better. (Dear reader, you must know that, while I do seem rather sarcastic and cynical, I really do love cross country. Besides the pain, it's a fantastically fab group of people. It's just that it's very easy to complain about. Not that anyone reads this... but I digress). Yes, so, anyway... ah yes. And, on Saturday, whilst everyone is dragging themselves up Gaviota Peak, I, in my Jeep, will be happily driving around in Los Angeles, shopping for back-to-school supplies, writing (in Italian) to  Sig. Cicale  back in Prague (or are they in Italy now?), and maybe taking in a nice leisurely bike ride around the lake.  Oh, and shopping for something to give to Ariel for her grand birthday spectacular that I know she will have in a few weeks. I feel like an old lady around all my DP frieds. Well, all my freshman friends anyway. I was just at Karisa's for her 15th birthday, and Whitney hit 15 in March, Ariel will be on the 16th of August, and Molly - not until January  of next year!  However,  I  shall be happily celebrating my Sweet 16 come November.  A round of huzzahs!, if you will. Well, I suppose I must be going now. I've loads of important people to see and many things that need tending to. Perhaps we shall chat again sometime soon? Baci, ~K                          So hello.  I've become so fed up with my other blog that I just need to start a new one. I've littered the other with stupid quizzes and mindless babble. So here I am.  I've not much to say right now, but I just can't leave a brand new blog naked, so I thought I'd post a quick note.  That being done, I shall leave you now. Tata. -K                                Live From Ohio, It's Youth Night!     So, the Youth Rally was tonight. I think it was a success. Maybe not. We expected 200 or more kids from different youth groups all throughout Ohio, but only 149 were in attendance. We started with the skit, which I'll get into a little later, then the activity, then we ate, sang discordantly, and had a sermon. The sermon was great, done by a Mr. James Hawkins, future missionary to Spain. The singing was bad and not from the heart, then again we wing it when we do sing at Youth Rallies. The eating was good, and there was a lot of extra pizza and soda, some of which I brought home due to excess amounts. The activity looked complicated and confusing, but luckily, Tim and I didn't have to do it -- instead, we got to make sure others were doing it right. And finally, the skit...  It was genius, or something close to genius. The whole activity was basically a spy thing: aptly named "Mission Possible," I won't explain the rules because they were complicated, but everyone was on a mission using their Bibles to stop sinful things like bitterness and laziness by looking up verses talking about each. Well, the opening skit went like this: I, in a shirt and tie and carrying a briefcase with a cell phone on my belt, started walking down the main aisle of the church. Halfway down the aisle (it's a small church) the phone rang; I answered it, had a one-sided conversation ("Yes, I have received the instructions... yes, we will be rendevouzing at the church tonight..." etc.), then proceeded to the front of the church. I laid down the briefcase on a table and started a conversation with Tim (who played "Agent Banks"). Following the few short lines we exchanged, I pulled out a tape, set it in the tape player, and turned it on; one of my teachers then, over the microphone, acted as the tape and explained the mission. She said it would self destruct in ten seconds, so I pulled it out, fumbled it around, dropped it a couple times, then dropped it back into the briefcase. There was a piece of flash paper resting on some foil near the top; I took out a candle lighter and lit it to make it look like an explosion. Then we exchanged two more lines and prayed, and it was over.  At least, that was what was SUPPOSED to happen. And for the most part, it did. But at the part where I was supposed to light the paper, the candle lighter decided that it didn't want to work. So here I am, holding the dumb thing and pressing the button -- click, click, click -- and there was supposed to be a self destruction. Finally it worked, and there was a flash of fire, then we went on.  Next order of business: I hate ProHosting. I set up the YDKJ forum (check the links) on free.prohosting.com, because they offer unlimited bandwidth for no price. Now I get an email saying that they want a one-time $10 membership fee to remove the ads. So I need a credit card and I have to pay $10 once in order to have an ad-less forum. I don't even *want* the ads gone, but I don't have a choice. It's pay or wave goodbye to your account. I'm upset about this, and emailed them saying that they need an option to keep the ads for people that don't want to pay, but the stuck-up woman simply replied "we've offered free hosting for years. Please continue to support free.prohosting.com." Grr, it makes me so mad... anyhow, I posted at the forum, asking if somebody with a credit card was willing to contribute through PayPal. No luck so far, though. If I don't get it paid in fourteen days -- well, thirteen, since I got the letter yesterday -- then the account is deactivated. Thirty days, and it's deleted forever. So... what's a guy to do?  Okay, I'm about done for tonight with my ranting and all. I'll post again tomorrow night, same time, same place. Oh, by the way: Priscilla complained to me and whined that I didn't put her into the blog, so I say: Priscilla is a girl. There, I mentioned you! Happiness! Good night.                                 This Tape will Self-Destruct...     Hello again, friends and strangers. Time to make another page in the chronicle of Blog Blog Blog Blog.  Today was an okay day. I practiced more for the skit at tomorrow's Youth Rally. Tim and I really aren't prepared at all... we got barely any time to practice our lines, and only have a bare understanding of the core of what we're doing. Luckily, we're allowed to improvise, since it's only a short three minute skit. I want it to be a surprise for those who have yet to see it, so I'll post up the results of what happended tomorrow night. It is REALLY cool, and if it wasn't serious, would leave a lot of room for comical mischief. (All those that don't care, say aye.) Anyhow, we have maybe an hour and a half of rehearsal under our belts, so luckily it isn't TOO important, and the job we have to do will be done easily.  Dad picked me up today from school, and we went to my favorite toy store -- Best Buy. I need a new hard drive for my computer, so we took a look at what they had to offer; I expected to walk away with a 60-gig 7200RPM hard drive, but they didn't have any, and even if they did, we found a better deal. For about $20 more (after rebate) I found a 100gb hard drive. As soon as Dad gets paid, he's gonna grab it and bring it over to me. I can't wait. Right now I'm running a 7-gig... the new one will be nearly  fifteen times larger  than what I have. I've had this harddrive since 1997/98 when it came with the computer, and it's about high time I grab a new one. I'm giddy. Now all I need to keep my computer as up-to-date as possible will be a new motherboard and a new processor (400mhz isn't quite sufficient anymore, especially to a multitasker who uses Kazaa, Flash 4, and sometimes RPGMaker2000 at the same time.)  Ben Folds is amazing. I just watched his limited edition live DVD last night for the first time... he completely turned around Song for the Dumped from an upbeat song to a sadder song with a slower tempo and a different tune, plus he added a lot of extra stuff. I've never had the privilege to see Mr. Folds live, but the DVD proves that seeing a life show would be simply awesome. (Army was cool, too, I love the audience interaction.)  That's about all I have to say, so I'll close with this: HUZZAH, FINAL FANTASY X-2! Farewell.                                 Judgment Day     Today was a day I like to call the Day of Reckoning, or Judgment Day, or Happy Chainsaw Thursday, if you choose. First, foremost, and most important to me,  I passed my Biblical Ethics test today!  I scored a 94%. That had to be the toughest test I've ever taken -- the questions were hard, but, if I failed, I would have basically let my Pastor down, so there was an added sense of urgency. But I didn't fail, I passed! Yeeee!  Otherwise, Kevin was expelled today. The dummy got what was coming to him. Finally, after the supervisors and Pastor have been putting up with his crap for a long time, they dismissed him. A sad thing indeed, but I have no remorse whatsoever for their actions. He promised the school in a formal statement that he wouldn't participate in immoral and un-Christian things. Yet he did anyway. He got so many chances to change himself, and I mean a lot of chances -- even after the Pastor found out that he smokes and after many, many disciplinary efforts, he still got more chances to change. They believed in him, and he threw it all away. What a dummy.  And so I refer to today as "Judgment Day," the day that futures were decided. I kept up the work and devotion to God, and he kept up his wrongful ways and his misbehavior, and now the good Lord made some changes... I passed the test and earned the Pastor's and the supervisors' respect, and he lost it all. Pity...  So... Happy Chainsaw Thursday. I passed, he left. I'm happy, he's in big trouble with his life. The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away; in this case, well, both. But now I have some American History to bother with, so good bye for now -- if there's any new developments, I'll update.                                 HAHBHN-Day     I'm baaaaaaaaack.  Today's the first day of my real journal-y existence.  Today was, in summary, a happy-angry-happy-bored-happy-nervous day. I went to school. HAPPY! My supervisor was on my case all morning. ANGRY! I learned of my passing of an Algebra test. HAPPY! I went home and did homework. BORED! I went to church. HAPPY! I came home and have to study for a big Biblical Ethics test. NERVOUS!  I'm almost through with the Biblical Ethics course, I finished the eleventh lesson today and will test tomorrow. I'm scared out of my dress shoes. I've learned a lot from the course, though; as much as it took away from my mornings for the past two weeks, it's been real helpful in teaching me how to deal with life and how to live happily. God is spiffy. Anyhow, I have a lot to study, because I do NOT want to fail something like this.  Oh, and Edmund Randolph was in George Washington's cabinet. (Washington decided to save him for later so he stored him in there for safe keeping.) Dumb statement, but that was the main thing I forgot on my American History test today. Jefferson was Secretary of State, Hamilton was Secretary of the Treasury, Knox was Secretary of War, and dumb old Randolph was Attorney General. Why I'm reiterating this, I don't know.  The Youth Rally is coming up this Saturday evening. I can't wait. Other than that, I'm done. Good night, friends!                                 Ahoy, Thar Be Blogs - Part II     Look! I'm updating again on the same day!  King's Quest 2 VGA is also spiffy. Go check it out.  urlLink Tierra Entertainment is spiffy.  GO THERE, OR GET POKED WITH THE STICK OF DOOM AND LUNACY!!                                 Ahoy, Thar Be Blogs - Part I     This is my blog. I don't know what a blog is. Is it a journal? Yes? No? Why am I asking you?  I'm going to write something here. Let's see.  Eternal Darkness is fun. It lets you go insane, something too many people say they are in the first place, but it really lets you go insane. You get a sane-o-meter that goes down when you go insane. Oooo. Lots of fun.  I'm done talking about that. Now let's talk about what I did today. I woke up and went to school. I am exciting. What can I say, I have nothing to talk about. So goes the life of the lifeless. Ooh, look, potatoes!                                 Smelly fish fin made the tea?     Think of what tonight's title rhymes with. Here's three clues.   1. It's like Television, only it's grape or strawberry. 2. It happened yesterday and I'm really happy about it. 3. If you can't get this one, then you really don't know jack.   Give up? Of course you do. Tonight's title is a Gibberish question from the ultimate quiz show party game, "You Don't Know Jack." And what does it rhyme with? Of course, stupid, smell fish fin made the tea! That is...  Jellyvision paid the fee!  That's right, my ProHosting problem from a few days ago is been and past, because the makers of You Don't Know Jack -- who are really happy with the forum I put together and the fan support -- are paying the ten dollar fee! I emailed them and asked for webspace, and instead they offered to pay off ProHosting. Not only that, but they're also going to register and maintain our very own www.ydkjforum.com web domain! No more long URL! No more short-but-not-working URL! A real, live, .com address, free from our pals at Jellyvision! They have to be the coolest game designers I've ever known.  That was yesterday. I would have posted here as it happened, but I was too busy with my brand spankin' new $200 digital camera. That's right, we finally bought one, and now I can take high-quality pictures for things! Overjoy! Rapture! So yesterday was a really, really, way cool day.  Oh, and also, I never mentioned that I found a place to stash MOL. anytimenow.com offers 20 megs of storage space, I love it! So now my game is up for download. Check the Deli's Pick (link's at the left) to pull it off the web.  That's my post for tonight. Life is spiffy.                                 Austin Powers: "Mole mole mole"     Major accomplishment today: I finished the demo for my RPG,  The Quest for the Meaning of Life!  I'm proud of the ending I put together. I not only added the ending, but I fine-tuned a lot, like EXP and enemy strength. I sat through the whole of MOL today and did some bug testing, which led to the tuning -- I found 21 things that needed a fix. I fixed it all up and prepared it for the public; I'm not, however, going to put it online yet, not onto my limited Tripod account. I need to find a storage place like I-Drive used to be to put it up, because even though it's only 1.3 megs, I'll run out of bandwidth. (Heh, I could use prohosting, but prohosting isn't free anymore.) That's all I really wanna share for today. I got to boast my Gamecube to my cousin today. It was quite fun. So long.                                 Work, work, work...     Current Song: "I'm Moving On," Rascal Flatts     How things happen the way they do, I'll never know. Andy (you know, YDKJ host and Jellyvision webmaster) and I had been exchanging emails back and forth, discussing the legal matters of JV paying our fee and all. Finally, after several emails to and from each other, he emailed me and said, "Look, why don't you call me instead of all this slow email? It'll be easier." So, I reluctantly (yeah, right) landed a phone call to Jellyvision HQ, Chicago. My dumb voice cracked twice... Puberty's been and gone, maybe my larynx'll catch up to me someday. Anyhow, we spoke for sixteen minutes, discussing the board and chatting about Jellyvision and the hosts of YDKJ and all. It was a grand old time.  So much to catch up on... well, business first. Adam, Jellyvision's tech guy, asked me to port all the crap from the current board to a brand spankin' spiffy new account. I downloaded it all, and... well, let's just say, headache. Here's an excerpt of my letter to Adam last night at 3.   I downloaded all the files directly from the current account into a folder on my hard drive, and downloaded both the Perl and CGI versions of the YaBB source code (partly as a source for default files, and partly since the newest version contains security patches). I uploaded everything from the old board into the new account directly (making sure to upload everything in ASCII as per the instructions) to cgi-bin/YaBB/ and tried to run it; I get a 500 Internal Server Error from ProHosting. I messed with a few of the files, reinstalling the defaults of files that could've gotten accidentally changed or corrupted, and tried again; nothing. I created a different folder -- this time named "yabb" instead of "YaBB" -- and decided to try installing the entire system all over again with the CGI version. I uploaded everything in accordance to what I remember from my experience with installing YaBB before, and tried to run it. Once again, it didn't work, so I decided to give the Perl version a try, and made one last folder -- "forum" -- and followed the instructions exactly. Figuring from the footer on the error messages I was getting, I assume that it's a Unix server and requires chmoding of the files, so I chmoded each file as the instructions requested, and after I had done everything just as it was asking me to do, I tested YaBB.pl and got the same vicious error message. I went to the unofficial free.prohosting.com FAQ to see if they had anything to say about my problem with the scripts, and I found instructions to chmod each file differently than what the YaBB instructions asked, because "that's how Prohosting works."   Shew! What a load of garbage. Oh well. I posted at the yabb support forum. All should be well, if I ever get a reply.  Neeeext... using a Best Buy giftcard, I bought a copy of Dance Dance Revolution Konamix and a dance pad recently. Like, the other day. I had to return the pad a few times due to defectiveness, but now I have a working dance pad and I've burned 200-something calories.  Cody invited me to a Bible study that'll happen tomorrow at 1. I can't wait. One thing I've always liked doing is discussing the Bible with other believers, as I told Mewd earlier after a similar discussion. It'll be super-spiffy. Maybe even spiffalicious?  One final note that I won't touch on: my dad is getting remarried. I don't know what to think. More on that later. Goodnight, Saigon!                                 The old words are reiterated again     Current Song: "Smoke," Ben Folds Five     This entry isn't going to be long. I pointed IE to Blogger ten minutes ago and it just now finished the loading process.  Today, one of my first friends at my school, David, left. It just goes to prove one of my mottos.   Life happens, things change, people move on; can't expect things to stay the same forever.   The reason is really complicated and I'd rather it go without saying just now. But, my dear friend David has left the school, and I've probably seen the last of him today.  I added a song thing under the title bar. Other people do it, so why not. I don't feel up to avoiding conformism tonight.  This has just been an all-out terrible, stressful, depressing day. I want to end it with God's gift of sleep. Oh, wait, I can't -- homework. Overjoy. Well, I'll be off to do my homework while eating pizza and waiting for The Cosby Show to hit the air.   Note in advance: I apologize for not changing the "last updated" thing beside the link to my blog on AIM. I signed off already and don't wanna get back on. And I also apologize for the wrong coding in my last entry; I used  b  instead of   (without the period there, for the HTML deprived). The YDKJ forum uses  b  for bold, and I just finished posting there, so I used it instead. I'll fix it now. End this day already...!                                  Unessential     Current Song: "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road," Elton John     I don't know why Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road is my current song... it's going through my head.  Sorry for the lack of updating. Haven't found the time. I got it up and done Friday, and the YDKJ Forum is now the lowest of my priorities. It's all finished and together again, just waiting on the .com to be prepared.  Next... one of the two biggest things on my mind at this time: the weekend. I don't know. I love my dad and want to see him happy, but he's getting married on Saturday, and I'm very uncomfortable with it. I like Chris, I really do; but there's just something about seeing my dad marry another woman, somebody that isn't my mom -- and furthermore, I'm his best man and, since there's no priest (it's only a ceremony), I'm reading his vows off. That's a major struggle right there, reading off vows from my dad to another woman... I'm not going to let him down, though. I'm going to swallow my emotions and do it in a happy manner. But there's just inner hurt that I don't quite know how to deal with.  I won't get into the second big thing now. I won't boast about tomorrow until I know what tomorrow brings. (Not tomorrow per se, but tomorrow as in, the future.)  I just feel unnecessary, unessential, that everything I'm striving for is in vain. All the work I do, the hope I reserve, and the promising I make, it all feels like the wall's crumbled down and there's nothing to inspire me to pick up the pieces. I just feel like nothing I'm doing has any reason and that everything I understand is slipping away from me.  Pray for me, I need it.                                 One hundred two point six     Current Song: "Hot Blooded," Foreigner     Hot Blooded's been going through my head a lot in the past couple days. Well, one part specifically: "I'm hot blooded, check it and see -- I've got a fever of a hundred and three."  Yes, guys and gals, for the past three or four days I've been sick with some kind of flu or something. Tuesday night, I came home from my aunt's house and felt my head burning. I took my temperature, and clocked in at 99 point something... great. I felt like I was gonna throw up. Luckily, it's Friday night and I'm happy to announce that my face has not hugged the toilet bowl. However, it  has  hugged the ice pack.  Wednesday I had no school, my teacher's mother-in-law died and since it's a really small school and everyone's close to each other they called it off Wednesday due to her funeral. I wasn't feeling too bad Wednesday afternoon and all, and Wednesday night wasn't too bad aside from my eyes starting to burn.  Now we shuffle along to Thursday morning. I sat up and asked Mom if I could stay home since I'd been feeling a bit under the weather. She decided to try and get the best of me and said that the only way I'd be kept home is with a temperature of 100. She didn't think that would happen. I shoved the thermometer under my tongue and waited for the woman inside to announce my temperature. Okay, so I cheated a little -- I looked at the digital screen and saw my temperature in advance, but nonetheless I pulled it out of my mouth at 100.5. I was happy -- no school! Mom didn't really know what to say, but it WAS over 100 and thus I stayed home.  It was cool that I was staying home... until I awoke again two hours later. I spent all morning and afternoon in my bed, mostly watching SNL reruns (Alec Baldwin is awfully unfunny) and stand up comedy on Comedy Central. At three, I started surfing the channels looking for something else to watch. I turned on Montel Williams. Rape victims convict a serial rapist -- the topic caught my attention (no, I'm not some freak that's turned on by rape; I just love hearing about people bringing a criminal to justice) and that occupied my screen till 4. By that time, my eyes were burning up and watering like a broken faucet, so I rested my head and tried sleeping. Mom returned from the store and I took my temperature. I felt lovely after hearing the tinny woman in the thermometer announce my body temperature -- 102.3. Mom gave me an ice pack for my burning head and I tried sleeping. Somewhere in there, the temperature climbed to 102.6. Mom called the doctor and asked for her advice. The doctor advised her to give me some Motrin. I took the medicine at 5:30 and by 6:30 I was up and out of bed. I ate (veal parmesian, yum!) and got onto the computer. My fever had managed to drop to 98.8 -- joy. Time passed. At 11:45 I got offline and took my temperature. It was back up to 101. I ended up taking two more Motrin pills at 12:45 or so and tried watching two of the final three episodes of Cheers. I fell asleep at 1:45.  Woke up. Friday. I wasn't going to school. I relaxed in bed for a while; turned on the TV and watched more standup comedy. I don't really remember what all happened today, aside from playing Metroid Fusion and eating chicken-broccoli soup. I took more Motrin at 3:30 and got out of bed at 4:30. I fed the cats, drank some Mountain Dew and got back on the computer... and here I am.  So, that's my last couple of days. Still with me? Good. I'm sorry I haven't updated recently, it's sort of obvious why I haven't. So here's the update. Now that you're done peering into my life, why not download  Opera 7  and see the browser I'm now in love with? It DEFINATELY beats Internet Explorer and looks pretty cool, too. Yeah, Opera rocks. There, I plugged them.                                 Life Simulation's a Hoot     Current Song: "Zelda: The Music of my Groin," by Shael Riley     Don't ask about the song. For your sake.  Life simulation's a hoot. John's gotten me hooked on the Animalese-speaking world of Animal Crossing. That game is more fun than a life simulator should be. Of course, it was only a matter of time before those people hooked on video games and computers would need a life sim, and it's only those people who get full satisfaction out of living a pretend life. The game is increduously fun, and even the "real-time" bit feels appropriate. For the first time in a game, I actually felt "just seconds too late" as it was 10:02 and the store closed at 10, making me just two real minutes late. It's just the weirdest thing, a game that's awake when you are.  Anyhow, I don't have very much to speak of now... everything's back to normal and all, and things are quiet. I follow up a giant post with a tiny one. Faretheeallwell.                                 Hey! I didn't die!     Current Song: "Yesterday," by the Beatles     No! I'm alive! I just haven't updated, and for a good reason:  Because I don't like Microsoft.  Yes, Microsoft ties into it. Recently, well, not recently, about two months ago, I changed browsers to Opera, and Blogger doesn't work right with Opera. I guess they changed something or something like that, but now I can update in Opera, although the window's a little small -- anyway, I couldn't use Opera and would have to use IE, and I hate IE, mostly because it doesn't work on my computer, and partly because it's slow and Opera has a lot of cool features. (You get spoiled on being able to move Back and Forward with the mouse.) So, that's why I haven't been updating.  That, and my life is boring.  If you must know, recently: I got into Magic: The Gathering, I got into Zelda: The Wind Waker, and I got into bed and slept a few times. I don't really know what else interesting has happened. Steve's gonna come up to Ohio and visit this Summer, which I'm really excited about. I'm itching to face him in Super Smash Bros. Melee. Oh, and I've relaunched my  urlLink site , and now have a redesign and more content. Last night I finished The Bed That Ate You -- why not go take a look?  Oh, and I had a birthday! Yes, I'm another year older. And for my birthday, I received two tickets to see the all-time funniest comedian ever tomorrow night -- Bill Cosby. I CAN'T WAIT. (This entry says April 19th because it's 1:30AM, but tomorrow night means the night of April 19th.) It's gonna be spiffy!  That's all for now, I'll update again soon. Now, back to my song.                                 I am  too  a nerd.     Current Song: "A Certain Shade of Green," Incubus            urlLink take the nerd test.   urlLink  and go to mewing.net. a nerd utopia.       Yeah, Bill Cosby was awesome. I'm so glad we went, I had a blast. It was over too soon... just when I wasn't expecting it, "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, have a good night." It was a lot of fun and it was great to be seeing the man in person.  I really don't have very much to say... went and bought a Sliver deck in Magic. I love Slivers, they're spiffy and useful. But now I have nothing to spend...                                 Stuff and computer upgrades     Current Song: "Bring Back the Sun," Our Lady Peace     Today's just not been a good day. The start was fine, the end is... eeech. That's all I'll say.  I got my laptop about a week ago... $50 for four gigs, 80 megs of RAM, and 233mhz processor. I like it, it's useful, mostly for keeping my journal protected and hidden. (It's also a great way to play Half-Life.)  I also got a new hard drive from my dad... eighty gigabytes as opposed to the seven I had. It was all installed on the same day I got the laptop (April 24) and it works fine. And there's nothing much else new, so I'll just end this entry now.                                 The Dragon at rest     Current Song: "Mercyful Fate," Metallica     Okay, so we didn't drop SBC after all. Heh.  Mom managed to somehow get an SBC technician to come to our house for free, to get everything taken care of and out of the way for no charge at all. I'm impressed, dunno how she did it, but she did, and now we have our DSL up again.  I guess I can trust it. As it turns out, Brad found problems with our phone line. Surprising, considering our wires are so old, they probably gave Moses his phone line. Furthermore, the modem was shot in the first place, and the guy replaced it for free. I don't blame SBC for the problems; I originally thought it was the weather giving us problems, but it was our wiring all along that must've been jolted by the stormage. So now I'm back on my high speed. I love it, and missed it.  But now... I have nothing to do online. Maybe I'll go download some E3 trailers... Metroid Zero Mission's gonna be spiffy, by the way. Cheerio.                                 Urgh... times infinity.     Current Song: "Yesterday," The Beatles     Yes, I already used this song a few entries ago. But you know what? It kind of fits.  Saturday was wonderful. I installed a DSL router and we picked up a wireless card for my laptop, so I could plug the ethernet cable on into the router and have a split connection, the PC and the Laptop both online at once. It was COOL. The wireless connection rocked, it gave me hardly any problems and was a sinch to set up. I was up till five in the morning, just talking away, surfing, using the internet from my room.  Then Sunday struck. And when Sunday struck, "Yesterday" came into play. "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away... now it looks as though they're here to stay."  Sunday morning, I woke up, and guess what. The DSL light on my modem -- off! Yes, boys and girls, my DSL just stopped working. I spent most of Sunday fooling with wires, talking with technical support, scolding my modem, everything... it just didn't work. The DSL light would flicker, and sometimes it would stay on for two minutes, sometimes five minutes, sometimes it wouldn't even find a connection at all. Eventually, I deducted (yes, deducted -- not deduced, deducted) that something was wrong with the phone line, seeing as our phone was really staticy, but I wasn't sure.  *Click, click* Monday! I came home from school, and the DSL light was ON. Yes! It worked! For about fifteen minutes, that is. Then it flickered, and came back on within fifteen seconds. That's the story of yesterday. I'd be online for a nice chunk of time, then get kicked, and then get on, then kicked, and eventually it started kicking me into submission and I couldn't even get online. That's yesterday.  *Click, click* Fast forward to today. I come home from school... nothing. The power light was on, but the others were all off. No signal what-so-ever. And to top it off, our phone didn't work. It would be on for half a minute, with a bunch of static, then I'd get a dial tone. That was definately from the phone line, so I was right that it's giving us trouble... it's just too coincedential to not be the phone line. The phone problems and DSL problems started at the same time. Not that it matters anymore, though, because after watching the modem do absolutely nothing, then turning it off and on and watching it malfunction a bit, I called technical support. Guess what? My DSL modem is dead. Shot. No more. Down the drain. Kaploosh.  We're at a decision point. Either we sort out the many, many problems with the DSL, get a new modem, and then go through more trouble later... or, we kill the DSL bit and switch to Adelphia PowerLink Cable. I'd like to keep the DSL, because I don't wanna change my email address and I get 700mb or so of web space that I need to house files for my website. However, I am TIRED, sick and tired, of putting up with it! I want to get something that works. DSL was fine for a year, no problems whatsoever, nice speed, etc. But when the problems started hitting, they weren't minor problems, they all had a huge payload that threw me into a boat somewhere in the middle of Lake Erie and ran off with the paddle. So, I don't wanna put up with it anymore. Unfortunately, until we get things sorted, I have no broadband connection... but I have a solution.  While we get everything all together with what ISP we use, I'm going to sign up for a free trial of AOL. LUCKILY, my laptop came with a 56k modem, so I popped that in, threw in a phone cable, installed AOL, and got online using my uncle's screenname. (Sorry, it was my only choice... besides, you guys were in bed when I got on anyway!) That's where I am right now... on AOL. Tomorrow I intend on going for a free trial, so I can at least correspond with the world while we work on getting together broadband. Ahh well. That's my entry... huge as it is. That's my last couple of days. Aie...  OH! BUT BEFORE I GO! LUCASARTS RELEASED A TRAILER FOR SAM AND MAX: FREELANCE POLICE, THEIR NEW SNM GAME!!! WAA-diddily-HAAHAAA!! ...anyway. Yeah. Go watch it. Now. http://www.lucasarts.com  "WHY... WON'T... YOU... JUST... DIE?!"                                 'Could it be? Could it really, truly be?'     Current Song:  Space Quest Four MIDI soundtrack      We may have isolated the problem. Every time it's rained since we got the router two weeks ago, the DSL's been killed. The first time, Brad the Tech Guy came out and solved our problems. Until it rained again. Then the DSL was killed. That would be my last entry, 5/20.  Well, two nights ago, my youth minister suggested I unplug our cordless phone from the wall and see what happens, if it was fixed. So yesterday, I unplugged our cordless. After about an hour and a half, the DSL was stable. So today, I plugged it back in after school. After an hour and a half or so, while it drizzled a bit, the DSL flickered back out. I unplugged it. Hour and a half later, it came back. And that's where I am now. It seems that the cordless phone is our problem... however, it's supposed to rain more this weekend. We're going to keep the phone unplugged and if the DSL goes out when it rains, then the phone isn't the problem.. but as it seems right now, the phone is the problem. At least, the phone jack could be it... I don't know. But I seem to be back online now... I keep watching the modem to see if I lose the connection. Hasn't dropped it yet, and as of this writing, it's been on for half an hour. Well, thirty five minutes.  So, we'll see.                                 The Re-revenge of Yesterday     Current Song: "Yesterday," The Beatles     I am so mad right now.  It's been four glorious days of broadband for me. After the tech came out and fixed our lines, I was online again. IT ALL ENDED ONCE MORE TODAY! Ugh! I don't know if I can take this anymore! It stormed again, and now that it stormed my DSL flickers in and out. I'm back on Dialup... AGAIN... and I hate it...  Is it so bad for me to have a working connection?  Gah... well, I have this AOL trial until June 20 or so, so it'll be available until Steve comes to visit. Around there, at least. I guess a month is more time than I think, so hopefully it'll be once again sorted out. Things looked so good, too...  We want to stay with SBC, we really do. What are we supposed to do? I'm not going to keep this up. Here's to praying we get another free tech if needs be... because right now, it looks like it needs be. Sigh...  On another note, I've modified my layout, and changed the header colors to fit. Don't know why you care, though.                                 The World Has Turned and Left Me Here     Current Song: "Selfless, Cold, and Composed," Ben Folds Five     I hooked the phone back up at three to call Jessie today. My DSL's stopped really kicking me off... it stopped responding once, but it was different. It didn't flicker out, but just kinda froze while the router tried to contact it. It's now 11:43, so it's been solid for the past eight hours and forty three minutes... except that fluke. What do I make of this? It's not the phone that's the problem. It's OBVIOUSLY the wiring, and since Brad the Tech Guy fixed our wiring -- not to mention the fact that our phones and the phone upstairs in my aunt's house is screwy -- it's most likely outside the house. On the phone with Jessie earlier, it was kinda staticy. The DSL isn't following a pattern as to how it shuts down... it just stays on or doesn't. I managed a few games of Starcraft with Mewd earlier, too. I have no doubt that it'll flicker off again. But for now, it's okay... and the phone works and all... so... yeah. I'm going to bed.                                  Been a while...     Current Song: n/a     Hi there. I'm finally remembering to update my blog again... so, yeah.  Steve's here right now, sitting in the chair next to me, looking tired. He's been here for a couple days, and will be here until tomorrow, when he flies back across the United States to go home to his room decorated with the colors of his site.  Anyhow, I'm going to make this entry short; ever since June 4th, my DSL has been fixed. Pete the Tech Guy came out and looked at the wires, and sure enough, they were crappy. They were so messed up, any rainwater would screw over the line... so, yeah, it's been fixed and stable, and I haven't been on dialup in ages. And that's just about everything I have to say. Cheers!                                 Wooohoo! I win! One to nothin!     Current Song: "Tribute," Tenacious D      Mwahaha! These past couple days have been wonderful.  First off, and most importantly, yesterday, I asked someone very special to me out. I don't want to say who -- it's kind of a surprise right now. But I'm no longer single -- sorry, ladies, I know you were all after me, but that's the way the ball drops. (Okay, so only one lady's been after me, and she's now my girlfriend. Sue me.) So, yeah, that's great.  Second, I got my job! Finally, after stalling a phone call for a long time, I am now a maintenance assistant at a hotel. I'll be doing some janitor work and helping the maintenance guy, but now I'll be working! Finally! Money to go toward my new iBook! And I get the hours that I wanted! I am so happy about it... and can't wait till next week when I start. I asked for something after eleven, and the manager agreed whole-heartedly. So... money! Work! Responsibility! Tithe! Woohoo!                                 Tired and jaded     Current Song: "Emaline," Ben Folds (live)     Work is already makin me tired. I've only been on the job for two days, but my feet hurt. Poor me.  But I'm complaining. I really, really like the job. I'm basically, a janitor. I sweep, mop, clean the pool, help out Dale (the maintenance guy), take out garbage, etc. And I'm paid pretty well for my first job. Plus, I'm working a steady noon to four, weekdays only, so I get my nights and weekends. I'm gonna have that iBook!  I went out and got a Blockbuster Freedom Pass today... mom's paying for it, but I'm gonna pay her back when I'm paid. They're doing the freedom pass year-round, now, not just in the summer... $20 a month, and I can rent a game, keep it, exchange it for something else, anything I want for a whole month. And if I like it, I reinstate it and get it next month. And etcetera. It's a great deal. Tonight I rented MGS2: Substance, but I'll be taking it back tomorrow and probably getting Enter the Matrix. I just wanted to see how Substance was, and what was in it... but I've already beaten MGS2 several times and don't really need to go through it again, so I'm gonna go grab something else. So... yeah.  I'm sorta worn out, so I'm gonna probably get in bed. Bed, at 10:50... a summer first for me. Oh well.                                 All the children, siiiing...     Current Song: "Song for the Dumped," Ben Folds (live DVD edition)     Nothing eventful today, except that tomorrow I start my job... woohoo. I dunno why I'm suddenly feeling regret about it. I want to work, and make money, and get my uncle off my back about getting a job... And it's not like I won't be able to get online anymore, I'll be working four or five hours a day, nothing huge. And the work won't even be HARD. I'm basically a janitor, and the hotel doesn't usually need cleaning. I'm just afraid of it, I guess. Responsibility. Yuck.  So, yeah... that's about it. Talked to Jessie today on the phone, again, and beat Quest for Glory II with my wizard. Woo, now he is Deathfoot the Paladin! Yeah, baby, over 110 honor points. Oh, and last night I changed the picture of myself at the side, to reflect the fact that I've been in a good mood lately. The other pic was depressed-looking, because at the time I took it my DSL was down. The new one is happier. But, that's about it... so I'll just kinda sign out for now. Have a nice blog.  (By the way, the current song does my no means reflect current events. I've just had that version of BFF's Song for the Dumped in my head for a long time... and Ben makes it hilarious on the DVD, so, that's my current song. Woo.)   Late Update: Me again. Just posting some last minute worries about the job. I'm jittery, and want to find out just what's going on with my scheduling and stuff. I really want weekends off... all I need is 20 or 25 hours a week. Hopefully, 25, so I still have around $100 a week after tithe... but whatever I get is good. I'll hopefully be able to work after school when I go back, so if I don't raise the $1000 by the end of summer, I should still be cool. We'll see... I just don't want to give up too much time with my internet friends. The few people I constantly talk to are pretty much my life. Especially my girlfriend. So.. yeah. 1:08AM. I oughtta go to bed soon. I gotta wake up at 11. Hrm. I'm nervous. Pray for me.                                  What a wonderful woooorrllllld     Current Song: "Dope Nose," Weezer     I feel great right now. Just got off the phone with Jessie, so, I'm in a good mood.  I start work on Tuesday... noon to four. I'm really excited about the job, I just hope the maintenance guy doesn't schedule me for weekends... but if he does, I don't mind, I can get by on a few hours of sleep, I've gotten up for school and all okay, so. I'm sure I can handle it all. I just can't wait to start earning my money... check it out!    urlLink    The Apple iBook... 800mhz of notebook glory.     That is my goal, to raise $999 this summer and purchase an Apple iBook. I love that computer. I want one, badly. I'll need a new laptop, this one is spiffy but it's not too powerful and I don't know how much longer it'll last... so, yeah. I need a new one. I've had my eye on a Mac for a long time, and now that I'm getting a job my dream may become a reality.  Oh, another thing: I have a new host for my site! Update your bookmarks (yeah, right). Instead of http://renomasterson.tripod.com, it's now http://renomasterson.shadowonline.com. My new host gives me unlimited bandwidth, 20mb of space, CGI, PHP, Cpanel, the works. And if I need more space he can give it to me. Lorenz Pleiss is a very cool person. Anyhow, yeah, I have a new host, but the site's the same... GO SIGN MY GUESTBOOK! Time to blow this seafood restaurant. See you all later.   I got a job!                                  Find Therma.     Current Song:  Big Band, Bebop, and Bones: The Grim Fandango Soundtrack      Been a long while, hasn't it? I really figure I should update this thing...  I'm definately not getting that iBook by the end of the summer. I was just laid off for two weeks from my job... they decided that they don't have the money to support me, so I can't go back to work until Jason, the usual evening maintenance guy, leaves to return to college. And besides, I'm spending my money left and right as it is... I ordered Discworld Noir last weekend, and just ordered Tony Tough and Gabriel Knight 3 tonight... all adventure games. I won't play GK3 until I've played GK2, which Jessie's going to lend to me. But Tony Tough just looks plain cool. It's a revitalzation of hope for our little genre. I mean, come on, any developer COURAGEOUS enough to make a 2D game in late 2002, and to make it really, really good for that matter, PROVES that there's hope left in the world for adventure gamers.  And Discworld Noir's pretty cool, too. But that's a couple years old and 3D. I'm not saying it's bad, by no means. But Tony Tough is just really refreshing in that it's brand new, pretty much, and 2D.  I'll shut up now.  So yeah, my job WAS going good, and it will be going good again when I go back to work. It's a cool job, I enjoy it, and I get a good pay for my first job and all. But, whatever, it's a good vacation and I'm glad to have some more time off. I'll be working the school year, too, so... yeah. It's a good thing, because I have things to save up for -- Castlevania: Lament of Innocence, and Sam and Max: Freelance Police, and Full Throttle: Hell on Wheels, and other various wastes of money I might find.  Ahh, the working life is good.

So visit! Please! Populate!  Annnnnnnd... I'm off!                                 And then... I WASN'T HERE!     Current Song: "The I'm No Longer on Blogger Anthem," Reno Masterson     Well, lookie there. I have a whole new blog. And it's owned by yours truly, me, not theirs truly, Blogger.  So yeah.  http://renomasterson.shadowonline.com/log  There's the new one. Go. Enjoy. Indulge in news that belongs to someone else.  I suppose this is a bit of a landmark post... my last post on Blogger. I've been here for eight months... blogging away. Memories are stored here... from Youth Night to The Great DSL Loss of '03, to my summer job, I have eight months of memories sporadically tossed around in this little corner of Blogger. I guess I should say something meaningful, or philosophical. I mean... this is it for renomasterson.blogspot.com. It's time for a whole new era. So, after all the memories... I guess there's only one word that's appropriate for my Last Word on Blogger...  And that word is...   BLAEH!!!!                                  Erm... ahem.     Current Song: N/A   Current Mood: Apologetic     Ah... um... haha... yeah, well... hmm, and... ah... yes, with the, ah... and... hmm.  I'm back.  ...and I owe Blogger an apology.  ...sorry, Blogger.  I couldn't make it on my own. I'm coming back to Blogger. It's been exactly three months from today -- well, no, three months from yesterday, technically, but it's 3:52AM on Thursday night to me, so therefore it still feels like the 27th. Three months ago, I left Blogger forever, to start my own blog hosted at my own web space. Well, I posted... maybe four times there. Literally. I hardly used it. I didn't like it. So here I am, back at Blogger, because I need a place to vent my life to the unsuspecting universe.  Welcome back to my story. Get comfortable. This could last a while.  The first news item of the day is as such: ShadowOnline is shutting down. Yes, the best host I've ever had is going under. Lorenz has every right to close it, as he did it for free anyway... but still. I wish there'd been more notice. Bah. Oh well.  I'm very tired, so I think I'm going to go on to bed now. Tomorrow's Friday, and, and... ah, and... and I don't know how that's relevant to anything. Oh well. Sleep tight.                                  Luguuubrious.      Current Song: "Richter's Theme," Castlevania: Dracula X   Current Mood: Quiet... where is everyone?     Well, the Christmas season is upon us. Well... the Christmas season is upon YOU. It didn't really come upon me. It snuck up behind me and nailed me in the skull with a blackjack.  Where did it come from? I don't know! I mean, I KNEW it was the Christmas season, but it's December 23rd! TWO DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS! And I didn't even REALIZE it until a couple days ago! Where did December go? Where did NOVEMBER go? Oh, I know where November went. It sped past as I pushed myself through NaNoWriMo. Which, by the way, I completed. Yes. I finished NaNoWriMo. I wrote a 50,000 word novel in a single month. Well, to tell you the honest truth, I wrote 12,000 of those words on the last day. Yes... the  last day.  Twelve thousand.  ...wow. It STILL surprises me.  Anyway, my novel isn't quite up yet for anyone to see... I didn't exactly finish it as much as meet my 50k quota. Mind you, though, I did do it. It's just nowhere to be seen yet.  Mainly because my website is dysfunctional. As I said in my last post (about a month ago... I am lazy.), ShadowOnline closed its doors. I moved to ProHosting. After Christmas, I'm going to use $10 to pull the ads off of my webspace. See, I wasn't sure if it'd be worth it to buy ad-free-ness, but seeing as my account name is renosix ( urlLink http://fire.prohosting.com/renosix ), I figure that if anything, it'll be great for any pages I make, since it's not exclusively titled after The Deli's Pick. So once Christmas is done and past, I'm going to use that $10 in my wallet to buy my page away from adscurity.  And when I do, I'll be much happier.  Otherwise, you know what I did today? I finished up Fario's first demo, that's what I did. Well, the first OFFICIAL demo, of the fourth incarnation of his first game. Get all that? I haven't uploaded the ZIP file to my Yahoo! Briefcase yet, so it's not quite on the web yet. But it will be. Soon. I'm really proud of it. It consists of World One, and the World One boss fight. That's right, boys and girls, you get to  take down King Poopa with a shoe cannon.  What fun! What excitement! What a moldy loaf of bread it was to program! Hey, it's done, and that's all that matters. Now I have seven other worlds to create...  I've been playing Baldur's Gate and Riven as of late. I have to get back into BG, I haven't played it in a few days, and I have to flat out explore more of Riven. Wow, it's confusing. A lot of wanderlust... but it's spiffy wanderlust. I got the Myst Trilogy as an early Christmas gift, since it was only $20, and so as soon as I finish Riven (yeah, right, maybe summer 2004, seeing as I'm going to try my hardest to use no hints) I'll be able to play Myst III: Exile. Oh, the life of an adventure gamer...  Steve's been idle for four and a half hours. I brb'd to take a shower, returned, and he was idle. And has been. And has been. And has been. And now he's  nowhere to be seen.  I bet he fell asleep.  Also, Mewd is  completely unaware  of the elephant I bought him for Christmas. Mwahahaha! He'll never see it coming! Well, he will, since it's rather large, but he doesn't suspect a THING. Now let's hope he doesn't read my blog.  Merry Christmas, everyone. Tomorrow I'm going to my dad's house for Christmas Eve, and returning on Christmas Morn. I'll probably blog again post-Christmas... unless, that is, I get really bored on Christmas Eve and end up getting online or something. But I'll probably end up devoting my time to sitting in front of the TV, playing something that's compatible with my laptop. I wonder what Riven's system requirements are...   Edit:  AHA! Ludwiggy IMed me! SOMEBODY TO TALK TO!                                 2004, I likes you already     Current Song: "Brain Damage," Pink Floyd   Current Mood: Much happier     See? See? 2004 fi... fi... repaired my laptop problem. (Sorry, a certain key of mine coming betwen z and c is not working at the moment.)  It was a stupid solution. A VERY stupid solution. I'd done everything I usually did to correct the problem. You know what I had to do? I had to remove the battery while it was booted. That's right. While it was booted. And it worked like a charm.  Well, almost. Because now, after much knocking around of my computer to try and knock some sense into it, I guess I have a stuck key. See, it's weird. My... my... you know what, lemme copy and paste something here... x There. My x key doesn't work. In order to type the letter, I have to have it on the clipboard and paste it in when I need it. I don't know why. Furthermore, when I boot the computer, I get a tidal wave of beeps cursed at me from the speakers. After fiddling around, hitting random keys, the stuck key finally gives way or something. Also, for some odd, odd reason, I can't make a capital S or W with the right shift key. If I hold both the shift key and the letter down, then release the shift key, then the letter is typed in a bold, capital flavor. But ONLY then. Every other key works fine with the right shift. S and W work just like regular with the left shift. What gives?  Ah well. Enough about that. At least the laptop works again. I didn't lose anything, thank God.  I've decided that I'm tired of leading a life of purely digital entertainment. It's great, really, but you know, I haven't read through a book in the LONGEST time. This is all going to change. Today, I picked up the one-volume edition of The Lord of the Rings that I've had in my desk for two years and started to read it. Let's get one thing straight right off the bat -- I'm not a fan of LOTR. I don't hate it, either. I don't have any feelings for it. I've seen the first two movies, the second half-heartedly, and remember neither of them. I've always wanted to read the books, but, let's face it, I have trouble reading. For as much as I love writing, I have trouble reading books. I read words just fine. I don't have any kind of deficiency or anything. I just have trouble picturing things in books. I'm trying hard to get over that. I think it's because I try to picture what the author pictures and fail miserably, instead of issuing every character and place its own characteristics according to my imagination.  I'm trying to do more of that imagining stuff. So, I'm reading LOTR for three reasons: 1, because I'm tired of feeling like an idiot and saying that I have trouble reading the books. B, because I want to read the books and all. And III, because I'm  tired of people watching the movies then claiming to be fans because it's trendy.   Honestly, face it! LOTR is trendy now. It's popular, it's up there. Something once reserved to geeks is now a nationwide phenomenon. I don't have a problem with fantasy or LOTR or geekhood at all, mind you, but it's stupid how people are getting into it just so they can fit in. The movies are great. They're epic, they're detailed, the acting is great, the fantasy comes to life. I don't have a problem with the movies. Get that out of your head right now: I have nothing wrong with LOTR. And I don't have anything wrong with people who watch the movies and become fans through those movies. But many people I know are only into it because their friends are. They claim to be fans, but it's only a front so people will like them. This is why I want to read the books. Before I get into the movies, I want to read the books. It's an American stereotype to watch the movie instead of the book, and I don't want to fall into that stereotype. Movies are wonderful, but they shouldn't replace the book they're based on. In my humble opinion, before you go spouting off about how huge of a fan you are of the LOTR series, you have to have at LEAST a DESIRE to read the books. Josh is a big LOTR fan, but he hasn't read the books. However, he WANTS to read the books. That's an entirely different story. If you're going to be a fan, be a fan of the whole thing, and not just the movie because the movie is trendy and all of your friends like it!  ...huff, huff...  ...I'm going back to reading.                                 One final curve     Current Song: "The Stranger," Billy Joel   Current Mood: ...     Well, 2003 has thrown one last hurdle right at my face. While talking to Jessie and Mewd, I hit that little switch next to my CD-ROM drive that ejects the drive from the laptop, which always throws my computer into an instant suspend, and when I take it out of suspend, it's frozen.  Now, this has happened. Often. And when it does, I just unplug it, take out the battery, then put both power sources back in and reboot it.  Not this time.  The laptop no longer turns on. The light'sll go on and the hard drive will start to creak, but that's the end of it. Monitor never even turns on. I don't know why. Judging from the circumstances, it doesn't look like a virus or anything. For one, this has happened before, just... not for quite this long. Two, this happened because of my hitting the switch. I think it might just be because the computer is a bit overheated -- I always put it in suspend and never in shut-down, and just restart when I have to. Else, I don't know. I have the battery out and the power unplugged. I'll plug it back in later.  At the end of November, I had to reformat thanks to a software problem in which my sound poofed away. As such, I have everything from April 26th up till November 26th saved. 800mb of backup on the PC. Unfortunately, everything from November 26th up 'till now is gone. My SNES ROM collection, for instance. Oh, and  my website.  Yeah, that's gone too. Not to mention my progress in Riven and GK2, and countless other trinkets I've downloaded since. Remember that save file I never told you about where I had almost beaten Zero Wing in Round Three? Gone. This is a major letdown.  No, can't let that mindframe get a hold of me. I WILL fix that laptop. I don't know how, but it will get fixed. Somehow. Anyhow. It will. It must. It has to.  And no, I'm not going to apologize to you, 2003. I'll let 2004 be the year I fix it.                                 The end of an era     Current Song: "Bob," Weird Al   Current Mood: Pensive     Well, I'm feeling a lot better today than I was last night. I don't know what got over me. Jessie left to take a shower, and the whole time I just stared at her IM, waiting for her to come back, while listening to Dark Side of the Moon. I tried to pull myself away, but I just kept staring... and staring... and staring... and... augh! I got depressed! Help! Help! Getitoff!  Anyway, I didn't start this entry to write that. I came to write about 2003.  First off, the obligatory paragraph entitled "Where Did the Time Go (I'm Getting Old)" that starts these kinds of posts.   Where Did the Time Go (I'm Getting Old)   Well? Where DID it go? You know, 2003's been awfully funny. It seems like the year zipped by. I feel like I just took down the Christmas tree at the end of last Christmas. I feel like my dad just married my stepmom. I feel like I just had that sixteenth birthday party. I feel like I just saw my uncle at the Super Bowl party two months ago. And yet, at the same time, I feel like 2003 shouldn't be ending. Seriously. I feel like it's been 2003 for ages, and that it shouldn't change just yet. Why? I don't know. That's why I'm ranting about it. This year feels so funky.  Now, on to the meat of the blog entry:   What a freakin' year.   Lessee... 2003. What all happened? Well, my dad got married to my stepmom in Februrary. I turned sixteen in April. I got my domain name (mwahaha). Well, first I moved to ShadowOnline. THEN I left it and got my domain name. I had a job, for three weeks, then I got fired. Steve came to visit for a few days and put me to shame in Smash Bros. Melee. And most importantly, on June 23rd, Jessie and I started dating. It's been six months since we started now... wow. THAT shot by, fast. Hmm. Really fast.  Well, we're about to head out to dinner at the Olive Garden now. I still have to write a letter to Jessie telling her that I might not be on till later. Anyway, that's my featureette on 2003...  see you next year, hosers!   *sets up a bomb next to 2003*                                 I'll see you on the dark side of the moon     Current Song: "Eclipse," Pink Floyd   Current Mood: Melancholy     I don't feel all that great right now. Dunno why. Just down.  All that you touch All that you see All that you taste All that you feel All that you love All that you hate All you distrust All that you save All that you give All that you deal All that you buy Beg, borrow or steal All you create All you destroy All that you do All that you say All that you eat Everyone you meet All that you slight Everyone you fight All that is now All that is gone All that's to come And everything under the sun is in tune But the sun is eclipsed by the moon.                                  The lunatic is in my head     Current  Song:  CD: "The Dark Side of the Moon," Pink Floyd   Current Mood: Very, very lost     What? Who? Me? No. You? Why? Sure. Huh? Oh. No. No! Wait. What?  Exactly. I've been listening to The Dark Side of the Moon for hours tonight, and it's really getting to me. The music is... confusing. I feel lost. It's entrancing, and VERY eerie. Compelling, too. I'm quite lost. Didn't I already say that? Oh. Yes. Right.  Hmm.                                 It's December 29th! You know what THAT means.     Current Song: n/a   Current Mood: Relieved     What does it mean? That it's December 29th, of course.  Yaargh. At 9:20 or so, tragedy struck: a stinkin' search page screwed over Internet Explorer. I couldn't visit any websites -- anything I'd stuff into my Address bar would be disregarded and instead would take me to the same search page. I virus-scanned. I ad-awared twice. I reinstalled IE6. I mucked about in the registry. At 10:30-ish, I left to watch My Cousin Vinny with mom -- such a great movie. (Thanks, Steve!) 12:50 I came back, and went back to it. And about fifteen minutes ago -- around 2:40 -- I solved my dilemma. As it turns out, I wasn't scanning deep enough into the registry. I found a bunch of wmmse.com strings in there, so I deleted all of them. Stupid things.  Of course, in the process, I accidentally killed the string that told IE to put http:// in front of a URL by default. So while I solved one problem, I had another to deal with. Another reinstall of IE fixed it easy, though.  So, Merry Christmas, everyone! Christmas was wonderful for me. Remember that webspace ordeal I had in my last post? Well, for Christmas, my brother gave me a great gift -- he ordered a premium webhosting package for me. I now have 50mb of space, 10gb bandwidth, and a ton of extra features, including PHP and all that jazz. The best part about it? Mwahaha -- the fact that my new URL is  urlLink www.thedelispick.com . Yes, I have a dot com. I'm rearranging the site again -- my last redesign is way too heavy on the tables, and I want a different look. That one doesn't satisfy me. It's sort of the same, just... just... different. You'll see. Eventually.  Anyhow, I'm back to watching the Cosby Show marathon and working on my site. Stupid wmmse.com... stealing half of my night...                                 Aaaaaaaargh     Current Song: n/a   Current Mood: Half-asleep     It's seven am... I just woke up from two nightmares. Urgh. I decided to go to bed on time last night, and ended up waking up around four or so. I was pretty thirsty, so I had some orange soda. I woke mom up, talked to her for a minute, then came back in and laid down at 4:20. I turned on the TV -- Three's Company was on until five. Good. Closed my eyes.  I couldn't fall back asleep. I laid there with my eyes closed for quite a while, but my stomach had decided to just sort of rumble for a little while. I just could NOT sleep. Eventually around 5:30 I drifted away.  I don't know when I woke up next -- somewhere in the 6 o'clock area. I had dreamt that the house and building behind me had caught on fire, and mom was out of the house. I panicked. I could FEEL the panic, even in my dream. I tried to call 911, but every time I picked the phone up, the dial tone would fade immediately. The phone lines were getting screwed up by the fire. I couldn't get online, or call the police, or anything. All I could think to do was to try and relax and play something on my PS2. I went outside, and my family was on the back porch, with firemen dressed in casual clothes working on the fire. Everything was just fine, but I was really nervous and all now, probably because in my dream my house was all rearranged and so it wasn't familiar to me. That's when I woke up.  Fell right back to sleep. That dream wasn't bad. This one was worse.  I was at Cody's house, and a lot of other people were there, mostly friends of ours. I sat down at a table with Cody and two others, and used the computer stationed there to check my mail. I opened Yahoo! Mail, and it was all weird -- this odd orange scheme. Instead of it saying that I had mail, however, it said this: "Changes made successfully: 1." I thought something was up, so I clicked on the one. It said "password changed." ...I hadn't changed my password. I went to make sure it was the same, and I got a long, huge page. There were tons of subsequent pictures with words on them from the female hacker who had changed my password. It started with an obviously fake error message saying that somebody had gotten my pasword, and then had some more jumble. Some said things like "Don't say some stupid prayer, like 'God please help me' or any of that crap" and whatnot. I was panting hard as I read it all, and was freaking out. I kept saying aloud, "My password, they got my password!" but nobody really seemed to care. Cody just shrugged at it, and everyone else was uninterested. Again, I was in a panic. I couldn't make sense of anything. After all, somebody had gotten into my mail account and changed everything around. Actually, it was all as if getting and changing my password was like giving me a virus, with the way the pictures were displayed. It surely doesn't seem like much of a nightmare to you, the reader, but man, it scared the pants off of me.  I woke up breathing heavily and sweating. I was so glad it was a dream. When my head cleared, I remembered what Yahoo! Mail actually looked like and was a bit relieved. After that, I just had to get into Blogger and write all of this down in my blog. It was my best way of having the dream written down and being able to tell anyone who cares, later on in the day. At any rate, it's 7:26 now and I want to play Castlevania a little before school. Have a good day, everyone.                                 I am the smell of fear.     Current Song: "Drive," Incubus   Current Mood: Relaxed     I haven't done a lot at all in the past few days. Well, I got my site up, and I'm working on getting Between Adventures back. Go check out my site, I'm VERY proud of it --  urlLink http://www.thedelispick.com . And go sign my guestbook. I'd appreciate it, thanks.  One last thing. Please pray for my brother. He's going to Las Vegas for a business convention, and he'll be there for eight or nine days. Thanks.                                  Waltz waltz waltz waltz waltz      Current Song: "Anything by Strauss," Because Waltzes are Cool   Current Mood: Beethovey            urlLink Take the Dead German Composer Test!                                     Bureaucracy!      Current Song: "The Coronation," Falconer   Current Mood: Sick?     I came home early from school yesterday with, supposedly, a stomach virus. It's been going around. Your stomach feels as if you're very worried or really guilty about something -- hunger pains but no appetite. From then on, you enjoy a couple glorious days of discharge, with either diahhrea or vomiting. I had the symptoms. Came home at 11 yesterday afternoon, ate a sandwich, and felt just fine. So I slept. I woke up a couple hours later, called Jessie, messed around a bit afterward, etc. My teacher called sometime last night; they cancelled school today. (When your school contains 16 students, it's easy to get an epidemic going strong.) So I had a nice day off. Furthermore, apparently many are STILL sick, so school was cancelled AGAIN tomorrow. Thus, I get a weekend within a week. I'll have one day of school, then two days of weekend. Mmm-mm.  I've been playing Douglas Adam's Infocom adventure game, Bureaucracy, as of late. The game is very funny, yet pretty hard, but it's one of the only interactive fiction titles I can get into. (Surprising as Cody and I used to make these things all the time in eighth grade.) It's a fun game, nonetheless, full of confusion and annoyances and featuring a llama and a one-winged macaw.  (For those who noticed the Spider-Man 2 template, it's gone now. Why? Because it was annoying.)  And so I end this post with a quote from last night's Conan...  "Ohhhh, what happened? Ohhhh, what happened? Ghandi happened! Goodbye."                                 A Monday for the Masses     Current Song: "The Luckiest," Ben Folds   Current Mood: Choked up      Warning. This post contains mushy romance stuff. If you don't like it, blaeh to you.   Tonight, Jessie spent hours working on a slideshow featuring pictures of the two of us with romantic captions set against "The Luckiest" by Ben Folds, which we sort of consider to be our song. She spent a lot of time fixing it up and creating it and putting it together, but after it was done, she had problems sending the .exe. It wouldn't open for Mewd (whom she tested it on) or myself but it was opening just fine for her. We spent another couple hours trying to resolve the problem. She searched Photostudio 2000 for some kind of help or option or preference and I went as far as to download a couple trial versions of the program, all in an attempt to be able to open the file.  As it turns out, she had to send EVERYTHING -- the MP3 and pictures and all -- with the .exe. After she did this, I started it up, and learned for the first time what it's like to cry from happiness. It was amazing. The words were very touching, and the pictures seemed to fit the words. I won't go on and on about this, as I'm sure you, as the reader, don't care -- but it's my blog and I'm gonna write about things I want to write about, so there.  Aside from that, noooot too much else happened today. So... so... I'm done with this entry. Bye.                                 The Expert Art of Stick Figures     Current Song: "The Coronation," Falconer   Current Mood: Exhausted     Things lately have been a bit quiet. Nothing really exciting has happened before today.  Earlier, I found something incredibly interesting. At the  urlLink Janitorial Times , a fellow by the screenname of TheRisingSun had posted a fix for the SCI timer bugs in the old Sierra games, available  urlLink here . For those of you who know what I'm talking about, go check it out -- instead of slowing down your system with Turbo or Moslo, this is actually a patch for the games. You unzip the patch that applies to each game into its directory, then play it, and the timer problems are instantly solved! No more waiting forever for the elevator in Leisure Suit Larry 3! Space Quest 4, one of the buggiest games in Sierra's history thanks to the screwy time, works like a charm!  The desert in Space Quest 1 VGA is actually playable!!  As I write this post, he's only got a fix for SQ1VGA, SQ4, SQ5, SQ6, LSL3, LSL5, and PQ3, but as soon as he can get a copy of QFG4 he's going to patch that game as well. I'm sure he's also got other things planned. Either way, these patches really honestly fix the games. The timer problems become nonexistant, from serious problems (SQ4's Droid o'Death, Skate-o-Rama, Sequel Police, etc.) right down to animation problems (SQ1VGA's constant head-swivelling, super-fast cartridge retrieval droid bouncing, etc.). It's like a miracle cure, only it really IS a miracle cure! Sierra fans with timer issues, check the patches out!  Secondly, Mewd and I buckled down and got to work on Sandwich Quest today. I decided that to get more work into my projects, I'm going to base my focus on one project and stick to that instead of bouncing back and forth between games. I decided that the one solo project I have that I want most to do is The Quest for the Meaning of Life. As such, MOL is my main goal right now. Well, kind of. I want to focus my solo effort on MOL, but I want an equal emphasis on Sandwich Quest. Basically, instead of having several projects, I have two that are what I want done most, and those're what I'm going to stick to.  Anyway, yeah, Mewd and I did a lot of work on Sandwich Quest today. I had accidentally deleted the original file back a few months ago when we were working on it, and so I started rebuilding it today. We didn't have much anyway, and all the stuff that was in the file was still on my hard drive, so I managed to keep all the art and stuff. I have the entire first room rebuilt; aside from that, I have the kitchen scene done and ready to be made into a room, and Mewd already has a lot of the descriptions written. Basically, I've pushed myself all night, and it's paid off. I'm proud of what all we have, even if it isn't a lot just yet.  However, it's 5:53 in the morning, and I'm going to bed! I emailed Jessie a half hour ago as I usually do and said that I was going to bed, and then I decided to update my blog, and here it is, six in the morning, and why am I still up? Sheesh, you'd think I was some kind of freak.                                 I AM dexterity.     Current Song: "December," Weezer   Current Mood: I dunno, anxious?        I did it in   1    seconds. I deserved an A++!! Take the  urlLink How Dexterous Are You? Quiz !!   Want proof?       Completely unedited. Yeah, that's right, I have  way  too much time on my hands.                                 Sunday. Yadnus.     Current Song: "Substitutional World," Falconer   Current Mood: Happy     I dreamt last night. And it was a weird dream.  I think I was in some kind of game. But it was all very realistic. I think I was kind of like Dante, from Devil May Cry. I was near the end of the game, as it was really short. I told mom that I was just going to leave and go back to doing something else, but as I was walking down this long hallway to leave, I had a feeling that my arch-nemesis would show up -- and he did.  He fell from the ceiling in front of me. I don't remember much about his appearance except that he had these glowing white eyes, and strong, last-boss-like red and black armor.  We then fought. It was a REALLY taxing battle. He had very strong attacks, but I could block all of them with ease. But I could never hit him.  He would spawn these... zombie things. Only they were zombies also wearing red and black armor. They were tall and very thin, and I really couldn't do much damage. I kept on pushing them out of the way, hitting them against walls, elbowing them and the like. I guess eventually I'd kill them, but I was juggling between then and the boss.  I kept trying to figure out how to kill the guy, but I couldn't. I think I had a sword and a gun. Well, I know I had a gun. I could never harm him. He'd do this huge dash, then leap a couple times into the air and wail on me with a huge combo, but I would block it. When he would run back to the center of the hall, I'd attempt to run and hit him with a clothesline with my sword.  I thought this was effective, but I don't think it was doing much. Finally, after a long battle, I managed to get him down onto the ground. I straddled him, curled my fingers in his hair, and pounded his skull mercilessly against the floor while calling for backup.  A few of my friends came and used some kind of ritual to draw the evil spirit out of him, and he returned to normal. Then I remember drawing my gun and saying, "No, I'm not going to let you live," and trying to shoot him, but the gun wasn't firing because the game was over.  And then, I woke up.  I also had a short dream about Jessie before that, but it was so  wild and passionate  that I don't DARE talk about it here. (If seeing her sitting on the couch and reading is wild and passionate, that is.)  Anyway, it's now 4:57, and you can bet your pants that they're going to be calling soon for us to go to dinner. So until they do, I'm going to continue listening to Falconer. I've spent the past ten or fifteen minutes getting my blog to publish onto my website, instead of on blogspot.com. However, Blogger can be an unfunctional piece of crap, and so it isn't working. I'll just stay on Blogspot. It's not that bad. And it's a heck of a lot easier than fighting this thing.                                  You shall be slain; all of you!      Current Song: "Just a Phase," Incubus   Current Mood: Fired up     I'm going to be performing tomorrow morning in church: a dramatic recital of Psalm 62.   Truly, my soul waiteth upon God. From him cometh my salvation. He only is my rock AND my salvation. He is my defence; I shall NOT be greatly moved.  How long will you imagine mischief against a man? You shall be slain; all of you! As a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence! They only consult to cast him DOWN from his excellency! They delight in lies! They bless with their mouth, but they CURSE inwardly!  My soul, wait thou ONLY upon God, for my expection is from him. He only is my rock and my salvation. He is my defence. I shall NOT be moved. In God is my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.  Trust in Him at all times; ye people, pour out your hearts before him! God is a refuge for us. Surely, men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity. Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery! If riches increase, set NOT your heart upon them! God has spoken once, twice have I heard this -- that power belongeth unto God!  Also unto thee, o Lord... belongeth mercy; for thou renderest to every man according to his work.   I especially like the second paragraph. I get loud, forceful, and convicting with my words. For now though, I depart; I'm gonna get a quick haircut then come back and play more of Gabriel Knight 2. It's really heating up. Anyway -- gotta run. So long.                                 Episode 263: "Soliciting Prayers"     Current Song: "That's Life," Frank Sinatra   Current Mood: I think I'm still shaking     Just earlier I had a discussion with Kat about God. Kat, if for some reason you're reading this entry, I apologize for keeping you for so long after you first stated that you were going to leave, but I really thought it was important that I speak to you about God. There is so much I have left to say, and so many things I wish I would have said differently -- it's a struggle to pick and choose what you want to say in the flash of an instant -- but I hope what I said had some effect on you. If ever you need to speak to me about God, if you ever feel compelled to go one step over what you've learned in all your therapies and whatnot, to lean over the calice you've built up toward God, IM me. Please, IM me. I'm more than willing to help you and encourage you. I guess all I can say is one thing Mewd mentioned: there's a big difference between religion and God, and though your religion wronged you, God is completely different -- and from what you told me, entirely contrary to what you were taught. God loves you; I love you. Come to either of us and we'll help you. I really don't want to sound pretentious, but I would just like to stress how important it is to me -- somebody that barely knows you -- that you wind up with peace in your heart.  I won't go into details -- here I am, writing in a public blog about somebody else's personal life. I'm not saying any of this to embarrass her; rather, to rally a call for action. My Christian friends, please, PLEASE keep Kat in your prayers. You may or may not know her -- probably not. Still, God'll hear you. Please pray for her. Pray that she recovers from her ailments, though most aren't things that can just fade away. Pray that she learns the truth about the Lord, and His plan of salvation for us. Most of all, pray that she accepts Him in time, that she finds that He really is the closest confidant one can have. Again, not trying to embarrass her or pry into her business -- far from it. I'd just love to prove to her that God and His followers DO care about her, and the 'cruelty' she saw in Him was an object of the devil.  That's really all I can say about anything right now. Aside from my girlfriend's birthday and my horrendous pile of a day at school yesterday, nothing terribly exciting has happened lately. Go read "The Hiding Place" by Corrie ten Boom. Great nonfiction novelization about a Christian family in Holland that fell under Nazi oppression in WW2. The author, Corrie, became a "militant leader in the anti-Nazi Dutch underground." She risked everything to save the persecuted Jews from Hitler's rage. Really interesting book. Very inspiring.                                  Weapons of Crash Induction      Current Song: "Loverman," Metallica (Been a while since they showed up here...)   Current Mood: Excited     ROOTERS -- At approximately 9:30PM EST on February 11, 2004, the assault began on the dictator, Error the Fifty-Second.  President Carnahan gave a propagandous rally speech before the event.  "The preparations have begun in our attack on Error," he began, invoking resounding applause.  "Our troops will raid the swamp. They will find Error. They will annihilate on sight. This is not a test."  The operation's treasurer, known anonymously as "Reno," finished paying off his debt to the operation's commander, also known anonymously as "New Rising Sun."  After the transaction was complete, the commander began his ambush on the unprepared Error the Fifty-Second.  At the time of writing, Error is in exile. His land now occupied by the Forces of Good, he can only manifest where he is unexpected.  Sources say that Error the Fifty-Second had many sub-errors, lurking in such places as the slippery slope and near the wraiths.  Commander Sun is confident that the sub-errors will be brought to great justice.  Minutes after the launch, President Carnahan claimed that "A full solution to the evil, vile, wretched beast that is Error 52 is at hand."  ---  Amazing, no? An actual news story. Huh. Very interesting.                                  So new, it still smells like Lysol!      Current Song: "Wield my Sword," Nightwish   Current Mood: Content     I've changed things around considerably. I was getting online to update my blog and noticed a link at Blogger.com about... something about Networking, and checked it out. A click or two later and I noticed something about finding new templates for my blog. Since Blogger.com's supply is AWFULLY limited, and I've been wanting a new template for some time, I took a look at the first link on the list of sources --  urlLink BlogSkins.com . I looked through the templates available there, and eventually, under the Digital category (I was drawn here due to my geekhood), I found this one, liked it a bunch, and saved it to my drive. After a bunch of editing away at the sidebar and stuff, I present to you -- my new blog. Very cool, huh? I love it! It spiffs! Immensely!  Immensely!   (And a bajillion thanks to Steve for hosting that above image while my site refuses to let me into cPanel.)   On to more pressing matters, though! Last night I finished  The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery.  Yes, Gabriel Knight 2, the only game from Sierra's FMV era that's actually good. The climax was a thriller. That opera... hoo, that opera. It had me shaking, not from fright, but from sheer excitement. But I finished that game, finally -- the museum in Chapter 4 held me up  forever.  Man, that was annoying. At any rate, I'm done with the game and am now moving on to Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned. It's about vampires, and ancient castles, and other stuff --  in 3D.  The interface is a bit cumbersome so far, but I'll get used to it. Also, Tim Curry is NOT Gabriel. Dean Erickson is. I can't stand Curry's rendition of the novelist. Which I make a point of in the sidebar.  Anyway! I'm going to post this now, because I have to, because, I do. Gotta study for Social Studies. For an era as cool as the middle ages, the work is awfully confusticating...                                 Funeral for a Friend     Current Song: (my Launchcast station)   Current Mood: Very unhappy     The deed is done and all is lost; my laptop is no more.  Day after day, I've struggled with that beast. Every other day -- quite literally -- it would develop bad sectors. Its performance fluctuated. The sound card was somehow becoming physically dislodged from the machine, as in the past couple of days it's been suddenly cutting out sound-wise. I've had to tap or hit the chassis of the laptop where the sound card was in order to get the sound back. The monitor was already going bad, and would sometimes display funky lines on the screen. I would have to hit it a few times to knock it back into place. The thing was really banged up.  Tonight, I was hitting it to try and get my sound back, and it just blinked off. So I turned it back on. It would get past my Windows screen, then eventually just lock up. I rebooted, and Scandisk prompted; so I ran a scan. It tried to scan the directory structure but hung at 31%, claiming that a bad sector stopped it from being able to go further. It would try its little heart out to scan it but nothing was doing. I turned the computer off then back on. I was prompted with the menu that lets you boot in normal mode, Safe Mode, etc. I chose Command Prompt as I usually do to scandisk again. Typed scandisk at the DOS prompt.   Bad command or file name.   ...Okay, change directory to c:\windows. scandisk.   Bad command or file name.   Um. Dir scan*.*? There was no Scandisk.exe. Anywhere.  Scandisk.exe had been wiped out.   Alright, so, maybe I can catch a fluke and load Windows. Restarted the computer. Not even my Windows 98 screen came up. It hung right after I entered my hard drive password. Crap and a half.  I eventually popped in my Windows 98 disc to see if I couldn't use it as a boot disk, or just reinstall Windows. It did an automatic scandisk to check for drive integrity. Aaaand it hung again, just like last time, at 31%. I shut down and rebooted, and then copied scandisk.exe from the CD back to my hard drive. At least that was resolved.  However, since my laptop used interchangeable CD-ROM and Floppy drives, I had to shut down in order to switch drives. This posed a huge problem -- I could only get to my command prompt using the Windows 98 disc, and I needed my floppy drive to back up things. I looked around and eventually found my old Universal Boot Disk -- if I could use that to boot my computer, I could use another disk to back stuff up.  The idea worked. I managed to get into C: and grab some documents and images. I'm going to go back sometime in the near future when things have settled down and see if I can somehow get back into Windows. There's a lot more I want to back up. Ohhh, is there a lot more. However, I'm not nearly in the mood to fiddle with it all now. I'm finally starting to ease up a bit. I've been very upset ever since it happened. I really wish I could just avoid school tomorrow and stay in bed, or maybe do something to cheer myself up. Whatever. The whole thing's a mess. I've written too much already so I won't go into my options for room-based personal computer replacement, or "What I'm Going to Do to Get Back Online From My Room." I still have the PC out here, but mom uses it too. I need privacy.  Top it all off with the fact that I've had the menacing smell of grape soda stuck in my nose ever since Tim drank a can of it during our Chess match earlier, right now I'm not feeling my best. I have homework but I want to play Callahan's Crosstime Saloon. Maybe I'll just shrug my homework off for a while. I need something to cheer me up.                                 Ease of Use? On a PC? What!?     Current Song: "I Get No Kick From Cocaine," Blazing Saddles   Current Mood: Surprised     I set about the gruelling task today of setting up, breaking in, and paper training our new computer. Amazingly enough...  Brace yourself.  While keeping in mind that this is Windows XP.  Still braced?   Things worked very, very, very well.   I mean it. Aside from a bad product key which disallowed me from the Office 2003 free trial (which I fixed on the phone with a Swede in tech support) everything's gone smooth. Even my printer setup!  And I've never successfully set up a printer on my first try!  It was spiffy! I managed to even print out a working page! Without hassle! AYAYAYAYAYAY!!  Yeah. I'm happy. The whole thing is wonderful. The monitor's a tad smaller than the old one but that's fine -- it's still a great picture and all. And I can bear XP. Overall, it's spifftastical. Three thumbs up.                                 Chapter 2: Everything Happens for a Reason     Current Song: "Superman's Dead," Our Lady Peace   Current Mood: Happy     Welp, we got a new computer today. One that DOESN'T suck.  2.8GHz. 256MB SDRAM. 80GB hard drive. DVD-ROM. CD-RW writer. USB ports out the yinyang (it clocks in at six, four in the back and two in the front).  It's on like Donkey Kong.   I'm really happy about the new PC. It's very spiffy; very smooth and sleek. It runs things in a very... very... very new-y manner. It's all Windows XP so the bells and whistles are present. I don't intend on removing it; I have the other PC in my room now (which is where I'm at) and it uses Windows 98SE, so I'm happy. Yes, speaking of, I'm glad about having the PC in here now -- 400mhz, 80gb hd, 128mb RAM, it's not as good, but it's still spiffy. It's been the best I've had for years and years. And while now a new computer has overthrown it, it still lives on in my room, thriving and giving me privacy and other neat stuff, like doughnuts.  But yeah, new computer, replacement for the laptop, and I'm happy. Finally, my computer desk has a use!                                 Troubled Waters     Current Song: "Like the Rain," Clint Black   Current Mood: A bit upset     Many things to touch on in this update of El Bloggo.  First and foremost,  The Passion of the Christ  is one of the most powerful, influential, and humbling movies ever produced. The film speaks so much strength and really is a very refreshing event. People direly need to see just what Christ went through when He was crucified, and it took Mel Gibson to show them this side of His life.  Secondly, LucasArts has officially lost about 5,000 fans with their  urlLink cancellation of Sam and Max: Freelance Police.  A petition has risen to save the game from the knife of the LEC Glukkons. It's already been cancelled, but we're revolting in protest of the cancellation. Please, if you have any adventure game spirit in you or if you're a big fan of Sam and Max or if you loved Hit the Road or if all of the above apply to you,  urlLink write them a letter expressing your disgust  or  urlLink sign the petition to bring it back.  This is an outrage. They'll know their mistake.  Thirdmost, Warcraft III is the most fun I've had in a real-time strategy game since, well, since forever. As much as I liked starcraft, WC3 changes everything around and turns the RTS genre upside down. I LOVE the single player campaigns; I'm actually rather good at them. I REALLY suck at multiplayer, though, so I stray from battle.net play. But for an introvert, single player is enough for me. And when I finish the four campaigns of Reign of Chaos, I have the expansion, The Frozen Throne, to look forward to. What a wonderful world.  Anything else? No, don't think so. Go see The Passion of the Christ. You must see this film. You need to see this film.                                 Lovesick     Current Song: "A Kiss to Build a Dream On," Louis Armstrong   Current Mood: Melancholy     The current song is a really, really good one. Mewd sent it to me; it's the theme from the PC game, Fallout 2. I was looking for some 50's-style music for something I'm working on, and while it isn't bouncy like I wanted, it's a very good, very slow song.  I'm really feeling out of whack and disoriented right now. My grandmother, great-aunt, aunt, and uncle are going to Florida for ten days with travel time, and again, they're calling on me to mind their house while they're gone. I'll be watching over my aunt, uncle, and grandmother's house while two of my cousins are taking up my great aunt's house next door. With my cousin David living at my aunt's house, it'll essentially be four cousins watching two houses.  This usually isn't a problem, but apparently, David's recently started to use the computer after everyone goes to bed. Hopefully there's no contention for computer use. Also, since my aunt wants to use AOL in Florida, and doesn't want the account tied up, I'll be installing SBC Yahoo! Dial-Up over at her house, and using that to get online. I may just take my computer over and hook up all the peripherals to it, so I can have a familiar experience over there. With this there, my cousin probably won't be too inclined to use it as it's mine. However, I'm not sure. I'll probably just use hers, and if I direly need my own PC, I'll take it along. I'm not sure.  At any rate, the whole thing has me discombobulated. I've been sick for the past couple of days. Nothing serious -- diahhrea -- but all of last night, I had the distinct queasy feeling that I'd be vomiting. I spent two and a half hours going in and out of the bathroom for long periods of time. While I finally lied down at 2:40 or so, I didn't actually fall asleep until 4 -- I just half-dreamed (you know, that thing where you're conscious, but vivid thoughts are swimming in your head). I woke up again at 7 when mom went to work, and then actually got up at 11. I felt much better, at least. Still, that's the second day this week I've taken a sick day, the first being Tuesday (I had the bug mildly but thought I had it bad). I'm not ready to go back, and I still don't feel all together. I feel like things are happening really fast. And at the same time, I'm really emotional -- maybe it's due to lack of sleep, or a combination of that with the traces of the bug still in me, but since Jessie left about half an hour ago, I've really, really missed her. Maybe it's because the song is really romantic and melancholy or something -- I dunno. All I know is, I really wish I could talk to her again soon. I'll probably call her before bed, as I always do, but... I dunno. I miss her.  Soon, we're going over to my aunt's house again. It's 9:45 at the moment I write this. They're leaving at 5:00am. Thusly, we won't be there to see them off, unless mom and I wake up early. Anyway, we're gonna go over there to say goodbye and for last-minute instruction and all that. I guess I'm just really nervous. I feel very alone, and I don't know why.  Have a great weekend. I'll write again when I'm all settled in. Sorry for the delay between posts.                                Current Song: "Wayfaring Stranger," Trace Adkins   Current Mood: Tired    Seriously.                                Current Song: "Whiskey Lullaby," Brad Paisley   Current Mood: Melancholy?    I'm sorry that I've forgotten lately to update the ol' weblog. When I was at my aunt's house, the dialup, combined with the forced 800x600 resolution and ultra-dim monitor, didn't exactly leave me wanting to update.  The housesitting went about as well as possible. Catch an update: the ten days went slightly roughly, with me spending a lot of time cleaning and my cousin spending a lot of time not cleaning. When I'd finally be done cleaning and doing homework, he'd be online. For the most part, everything was alright, I suppose. Well worth the $100 pay, even though I wasn't really doing it for the money. A few days after finally leaving their place, I spent a weekend over at my brother's. Talk about refreshing. I had minimal cleaning up to do and plenty of freedom and aloneness. They didn't pay me, but that's no problem at all -- I didn't expect any money for letting the dog out, eating Chips Ahoy and playing Baldur's Gate. It was more of a vacation than anything.  Now, back to the present. I've had both Whiskey Lullaby and A Kiss to Build a Dream On in my head all day, and I was listening to both as soon as I got home, but eventually dropped off Kiss and am now just listening to Whiskey Lullaby. It's a really sad song, about two people who drank themselves to death over each other.   "She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger, And finally drank away his memory. Life is short, but this time it was bigger Than the strength she had to get up off her knees. They found her with her face down in the pillow, Clinging to his picture for dear life... We laid her next to him beneath the willow, While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby."   Mewd once said that he thinks it's silly when people post lyrics, because you don't get the full effect unless you hear the song. This applies. The song, as Jessie described it, is painfully eerie. Definitely the saddest song I've heard in a while. And you know what? I love it. I really dig slow, sad songs like this.  At any rate, today wasn't too bad. The past few weeks, however, have been hellish. My schoolwork is really falling behind, and getting very late. I finally finished another part of Chemistry today -- I surprisingly aced the self-test with a 100 -- but Geometry and English are still nipping at my heels. Once I finish Geometry and English, though, I'm  finally  in the clear. It'll feel good... really good. It's like when you're guilty of something, and the pain is eating away at you, clenching your heart and wringing it out, until finally you confess to someone, anyone, and the pain dissipates. Ashley's felt the same heat I have. We both feel like we're pretty much under the gun -- our infinitely untactful teacher loves to make us feel terrible with remarks that we would readily accept as advice with any other tone of voice. I dunno -- once I get this stuff done and in, I'll feel so much better. Much better.  On the brighter side, I've added two additions to the Compaq -- another 256 megs of RAM and a 64 meg GeForce MX 4000 video card. It's all souped up now, and plays Halo like a dream. Now I just need to get a job so I can buy Armed and Dangerous (the only exception I'm making to my 'boycott LucasArts' mindset -- it's my duty as a Sam and Max 2 revolutionary to support such a wonderfully made original effort at a game). I'm going to take my brother's advice and look into a job at the local cemetary. Nobody would bother me there, and personally, I'd rather be haunted than deal with other human beings.  I think that's enough for this entry, though. I'm going to do my homework then read or something for a while, waiting for Jessie. Heads up, Deli fans -- I have a new design in the works and I'm currently learning the humongously-awesome Inform programming code for making text adventures, or interactive fiction, if you will. IF is my oldest programming passion. One last thing: I've updated the sidebar to reflect current-ity. Catch you later.  > quit  Are you sure you want to quit? (Yes or no.) > yes                                Current Song: "I Believe," Diamond Rio   Current Mood: Productive (!)    Heyo, folks. Ready to blog? I sure am.  Confused by the title? I'm sure you are. Let me run it down for you, nice and easy: I'm wiping away my computer and starting fresh. I've reformatted computers several times; I'm a reformatting  demon.  Let's see, I formatted my computer twice, then eventually got a new hard drive, and I formatted my laptop once. So that's about four fresh starts. Anyhow, this is all ancient history; what you're concerned with is the here and now (or, actually, in your case, the there and then, as you're probably not reading this as I type it, unless you're a hacker watching my every keystroke, and if you are, please bring me a doughnut, I want doughnuts).  Here's the deal. My computer now has taken a liking to the dark side of freezing. It's flirted with such evilness several times, even managing a convoluted fit of blue screens, once, where I could only use it one in four times after booting. It just wouldn't work -- it'd load to the desktop, then, all of a sudden, without warning, without so much as a peep or a click -- WHAMMO! Blue screen! Recently, though, it's decided to itself, "Say, I think I'll just freeze upon the occurance of some random little process deep in the bowels of my monstrous bulk." (And it's bulky, all right. I once found a small child trapped inside.) "Let's see, how can I really ham this up? How can I truly peeve off the Typer Of The Keys? Think think think... aaahhhh... aha! Genius! I'll  stop responding to everything he does,  yet at the same time I'll let him  move his mouse all over the screen!  And while I'm at it, while I'm at it... ohhh, baby, while I'm at it, I'll make a  slow, quiet ticking,  to make him THINK I'm doing something, but then ultimately letting him down when he realizes that I've committed neo-seppuku once more! Whoa! When can I start this... when when when... how about... how about next time he boots! Oh, Gatey," (my computer calls itself Gatey because it's a retard) "you are amazing. Give yourself a pat on the metallic hull, you nutsy beast."  This is the gist of my problem: random freezing. Among other things, of course. My massive 80-gig hard drive will likely take quite a while to format, so I'm going to go take care of that now. It is 4:29. I'll write again in a bit -- sayonara!  -~-  Hey, blog reader! The time is now 7:53, and the formatting is well on its way. It's formatting at about 1%/15 seconds, so that's 4% in a minute. 40 in ten minutes, thus 80 in twenty, thus 100 in twenty-five -- it'll be done around 8:15. There's your Math Example of the Day?, kids.  I have five CDs worth of stuff; three containing data that I'm wanting to keep, and two containing old laptop backups that I don't want to risk losing. I thoroughly, thoroughly scanned through my computer, combing C:, C:\Program Files, and my Programs menu. I found things buried in deep, but the only things I couldn't recover were my Neverhood saved games -- I don't know WHERE The Neverhood programmed them to save to, but they sure as heck don't go in the DreamWorks Interactive/Neverhood folder. Crazy people.  I'm pretty happy that I'm finally doing this. You know, even in its last hours, that computer gave me problems. It developed a nasty habit in which it would freeze for about thirty seconds every time I deleted files. I did a lot of deleting, too. In fact, I even did something childishly destructive, but it felt really good...  You know how, when you go into the Windows folder, it tells you not to EVER MESS WITH THE FILES INSIDE BECAUSE IF YOU TOUCH THEM,  YOU WILL BE TOTEMIZED ? Eheheheh... before quitting to DOS to format C:, I went into the Windows folder, and I  deleted random files!  Oh, it felt wonderful! I drug my cursor into a big box around some files, then hit Shift+Delete and wiped them out. Several times! My Windows folder looked like a post-war street with all the unpatched holes in it. Take THAT, Microsoft! And that! And that! ...And this, also!  So... so yeah. I'm gonna go on ahead and post this now -- thanks for sticking around to read my onslaught of C: formatting goodness. Have a night.                                Current Song: "Metroid Prime Theme," who do you think?   Current Mood: Ecstatic    Holy crap! Has anybody seen the latest from Nintendo at E3? Another realistic Zelda game! More info on Metroid Prime 2! Just look at all the crap on the Nintendo DS! Holy cow! Ho-lee cow!  I'm sorry, folks. I'm in shock. Pure, utter shock.  The DS will have the functionality of a Nintendo 64.  A Nintendo 64.  And it's a portable gaming system. And one of its two screens is a touch-screen. And it has voice recognition. And it will probably have support for a wireless network for online portable gaming.  PS3? NextBox? Pshaw. I don't care if Microsoft unveils their newest and latest brand of Sensation Heightening Integrative Technology for their new Xbox. I don't care HOW powerful the PlayStation 3's processor is. The Nintendo Dual-Screen is going to do for portable gaming what the Game Boy Advance did for portable gaming.  ...yeah.  Anyway, I would post links to all this content, but I just can't bring myself to do anything but squeal like a little girl.  urlLink Nintendo.com  has a lot of screenshots and info about their latest offerings, and  urlLink Games Are Fun  is always trustworthy for news. Also of note might be  urlLink GameSpot  or something. Just go feed on screenshots and videos of the latest technology. E3 never ceases to amaze.  Before I go, some food for thought: until 2002, Nintendo hadn't released a Metroid game for almost ten years. Two years later, they've announced their fifth since Prime was released. Metroid, Metroid 2, Super Metroid, Metroid Prime, Metroid Fusion, Metroid Zero Mission, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, and Metroid Prime: Hunters. Does Nintendo know a cash cow or WHAT?                                Current Song: "Never Loved a Girl," Aerosmith   Current Mood: Giddy    Mewd has a PlayStation 2. Mewd has a PlayStation 2.

You are a  really sad person  when you get excited because somebody  ELSE  got a new console.                                Current Song: "Back Back Train," Aerosmith   Current Mood: Ever realize how silly this "Current Mood" bit is?    I'm sitting here at Microsoft Works, pulling my hair out over an English assignment. It's driving me up the wall. I have to write an editorial on some current event, debatable situation, or news item. After several starts, I just can't seem to pull off the assignment.  I started by trying to write about how America hates President Bush, and the world hates America, and everybody thinks we're policing the world. I wanted to take a stance against all this for once, and argue for America instead of against it. I gave up after a few failed paragraphs, though, and now have decided to write about how terribly corrupted America's youth is today. I want to write a moving article about the vices that most teenagers so willingly accept. I'd just love to put together a rousing rally against trendy people with their trendy rap music and their annoyingly "fashionable" clothes  (what is so appealing about the color baby-blue, throwback jerseys, or $200 shoes!?) . Maddox said it best: we don't need 'metrosexual' pretty boys like Ben Affleck. We need real men, like Gregory Peck. I'm tired of seeing all these preppy pretty-boys. We need more lumberjacks and pirates. Men who wear flannel instead of cargo pants. This is what I need to stress in my argument.  But how do I start it?  I've given it more openings than the World's Largest Sponge, but none of them seem to fit. I know WHAT I want to fight; I just don't know HOW. So here I sit, blogging on this  urlLink annoying new Blogger interface  (yes, it's terrible), while listening to Aerosmith and trying to squeeze an idea out of my pea-sized brain.  Speaking of Aerosmith, I just picked up their newest CD today: Honkin' On Bobo. I read about it returning to the band's roots. The songs are all bluesy-rock, and they're very well done. Aerosmith's last CD, Just Push Play, was decent. I liked it, but the novelty wore off fast. This new disc is an entirely different story. The songs are thick and dirty, and have much more heart than the crap running through our airwaves today. (Just where did AC/DC stop and "NoFX" and "Audioslave" begin? "Tantrix?" What? My God, I wouldn't be able to tell you the difference between these faceless, hyped-up numbers if a Soviet threatened to shoot me in the face with a bazooka.)  Anyway, I should get back to my work now... I just have no ideas. I even had trouble writing this blog entry. Everything I say keeps feeling heartless, limp, and flat. Yaarg, I can feel myself digging deeper into the rut with every phrase I guillotine with my backspace key. Look there, I just went back and added a sentence that I missed before. I'm really off the mark tonight. Be glad I left AIM early, Mewd, else you'd get a faceful of stupid remarks and unfunny not-wit.                                Current Song: "The Odyssey," Symphony X   Current Mood: Quite productive     Triumphant champion of Ithaca! Let a new life begin; this is the end of my odyssey.   I stayed home from school today due to some pretty nauseating feelings last night. I felt a dash of inspiration around noon, though, and proceeded to resume work on my new site layout.  Now, 4:46, four hours and forty-six minutes later, and I'm done and uploaded. I finished everything, added descriptions for all my stuff, and linked up every image and page.   urlLink Go see.    UPDATE: nevermind, not done. UPDATED UPDATE: Redone. Now it works just fine. Check it out.                                 Current Song: "Sonne," Rammstein   Current Mood: a bit down.    Yeah, tonight's been odd. I finished System Shock 2, and it was great -- though the last boss wasn't as drawn out as it should have been. Aside from that, I had a lovely excursion dying miserably in Warcraft III. Lessee, I also watched a bit of the Matrix: Reloaded. Man, that Smith fight scene was spiffy. "Me, me, me." "Me, too!"  Is it just me or do kids suck? A group of three five-year-olds decided to tease the dog today. They accomplished this by pounding on the bedroom window and playing "ring the doorbell then run like little five-year-olds about to receive a bloodthirsty hammer claw in the back of the neck." That game was a blast. Here's how you play by example.  I hear the doorbell ring. "Who could that be?" I think to myself. I look up, and lookie there -- nobody at the door. So I get up and walk to the door, look out the window, and there's nobody there. "What gives?" I ask. Looking at the sidewalk I see three little black kids, two girls and a boy (I think) running from my steps.  "So this is what we're gonna do tonight," I say to myself, and unlock the door. Next time I'll be ready. I sit back down and go back to blasting the Many into oblivion in System Shock 2. Ten minutes later, the dog starts barking.  I get into position.  Looking outside, I find two of the little runts walking up to the front of the house. They stand right in front of the steps and look straight up at the door. The dog is barking, so they know they're seen. Suddenly, one hoots a warcry!  "Boo!"  HWAH! I grab the handle and fling the door wide open. One bugger dashes. The other stands. Staring. Grinning.  I glare. I close the door. I lock the door. I say, "Good riddance."  So after that, they left the place alone for a while. I was still pretty worked up over it, but I probably shouldn't have been -- they were only five year olds. But they were unsupervised! Three five-year-olds, roaming the street, without a single parent watching them. Where were the parents? Why, next door, listening to some awful rap song at volume level 201.  But that's entirely off the topic. Let's go back to the battle. Later on in the night, we get struck again. I hear little feet on the front porch. I get up, and make a quick Solid Snake strut to the living room. I see one advancing up the porch, turning around to look at its cronies as they cheer on its valiant efforts in budding vandalism.  It reaches for the doorbell. PHWAMP! The door flies open.  It stares at me.  The following dialogue is not even worthy of a Battle.net player.  "Can I help you?"  "Yeah."  "What do you need?"  "Yeah."  "Why are you on my porch?"  "..."  "What do you want?"  "I want co' inside."  "I'm sorry, I can't help you."  "Yeah."  "Please stay off my porch. Don't ring this doorbell."  "Yeah."  The little product of unsafe sex starts to run off the porch. No sooner was my door halfway closed -- halfway closed -- when they decide that the dog in the window wanted to be teased.  She's barking, the kids are giggling, and I scream,  "DO NOT AGGRAVATE MY DOG."  I'm fuming. I look out the front door window to see three little cornholes rushing away from the window.  The battle was over, but I was pumped. I tossed on some loud music really fast then proceeded to get offline and brood for a little while. I wanted to read but ended up just listening to Sonne and punching a pillow. I got my frustrations out, then decided to watch some of the Matrix before getting back online a short while ago.  What a fun night!  Before I hit the "Publish Post" button down there on my little Blogger GUI, I leave you with this thought:  urlLink it doesn't get any worse than this.  Notice the Christopher Snow books on the chair, and take note that they were on the table when the cat got up there. G'night.                                Current Song: Some stuff from Leisure Suit Larry 7   Current Mood: It's 5am. What do  you  think?    So there I was, on my second day of summer vacation, when I realized that I had failed to blog for weeks.  Not anymore. Nooonono, now I'm updating again.  Lessee... what's new... oh, yeah, nothing much at all. I'm on summer vacation, which means either three months of goofing off, three months of working at a job I have yet to discover, or a nice balanced li'l mix of the two. Both have obvious merits. Either way though, I'm happy to be away from school for three months. I'm struggling lately, with work and all. Next year'll be no better, but at least I'll get a good, lengthy chunk of time in which to downgrade myself to an undereducated mass of video games and large dinners.  What else is new... what else... something... hmm, I replayed Leisure Suit Larry 7 yesterday and today. Why do you care? Dunno.  Oh, and I  finally got UHF on DVD.  I'm going to watch it tomorrow. Ahh, Weird Al filmography goodness right there, folks. "This week, on U62, he's back -- and this time, he's mad... GHANDI 2!"  Sidebar has been updated according to my current boringness. And... and I guess that's all I have to say.  Look, I'm not forcing you to read this dribble, you're doing it yourself.                                Current Song: "Four Little Metroids,"  AmIEvil     If you hesitate before hitting the snooze button on your alarm, are you being lazy?   Good question.  It's now 7:30am. No, I didn't just wake up -- I'm just now going to  sleep.  You know, this post used to say "7:11am," until I  deleted the whole flipping thing on accident!  Arrgh! Twenty minutes, dust! Hrrm.  We got a lot of work done tonight on Sandwich Quest. I finished up the interior of Turnip's car, and Mewd churned out a few more descriptions. This game is really starting to take a great shape. The art is progressing nicely, the writing is, of course, hilarious, and the music is looking quite promising. In fact, Rav informed me tonight that he's already quite a ways through two songs -- Salami Mafia and the tentatively-titled Title Theme. The more we do, the more experienced and hyped up we get -- I'm honestly hoping for a fall release. At least, end of summer.  I had a lot written here, and to be honest, I really don't have the heart to rewrite it. I mean, I had a good four paragraphs -- four long paragraphs. Then I hit control-z to fix a mistake, and it deleted half of my post! Very frustrating. I'll rewrite it tomorrow night, when my feelings of enthusiasm are fresh again. Sorry about this. I'm gonna go get some sleep -- not that I'll be able to; my head is throbbing from my desperate attempts to tear out my hair.  Go read my profile if you're interested in learning more about me. I added a bunch of crap about myself, because obviously, if you're reading my blog, you just  love  to bore yourself to death. Ciao.                                Current Song: "Buy Me a Condo," Weird Al    Yes, that's right. Tonight, after finishing up our work on Sandwich Quest, Mr. Ravager asked for a screenshot of our work. I sent him a demo instead. When he was finished, this exchange occured.  ElRavager5: ::potential tunes begin coursing through brain:: I it's kewl with you, I'd like to try some concept BG-music... RenoSix: Wait. You mean you're willing to compose for us? Or am I just hallucinating? ElRavager5: I'd be delighted to. It's already very funny, and I'd love to try and come up with a corresponding soundtrack. RenoSix: Whooooa. This is quite a shock, as Mewd and I were just discussing how we wish we could have original music. ElRavager5: Yeah, I'd love compose for it. Most of my recent stuff has been incredibly intense, moody, and atmospherically dark. It would be a great change to do something in the humorous category.  This  rocks.  We were needing a composer. We don't like strangers. El Ravager is no stranger. This rocks.  I can't get over it. We have a team. Team. Team, team. Teaaaaam. Team. TEAM! team. Teeeeeeeaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmm... teamteam. Team. Team. 4:41am. Team.  I love the sound of that. Not just "Mewd and Reno," we're now "The Sandwich Quest Team." It has such a ring. The Sandwich Quest Team. The Team. Team. Teaaaaaaaaam.  That's all I have to say, though. I'm so happy. We have a composer now! And things are going so swell. Why, so swell, I think I'll post another random chat excerpt. Enjoy!  Mewd6 wants to send file 1-1.wma.  RenoSix: What is it from? Mewd6: Brandenburg Concerto for four Harpsichords, Strings, and Continuo one, movement one.  RenoSix: Ah yes.  Okay, okay,  two!  You earned it. Pat yourself on the back.  Mewd6: Roar. I am Metal Gear Samanatha. Cower before me puny mortal and tremble before my fearsome roar.                                Current Song: "Sweating Bullets," Megadeth    I changed my layout again. Tee hee. (Remind me to never say "Tee hee" again. Ever.)  Tee hee.  (Ah, crap.)  Let the blogging commence. Lost the old layout. It was starting to rust, and I had to let it soak in the bathtub. I have this odd feeling that my weblog is not at all exciting. There are interesting ones, like  urlLink ToastyFrog  and  urlLink that one that Al Lowe linked to in today's CyberJoke 3000  (Top Ten Worst Album Covers Ever. Devastatin' Dave...  yikes ). Then, there are boring ones, like  urlLink mine . What gives? Why isn't my weblog cool?  I asked a team of real scientific analysts why my blog isn't cool. After much heavy debate and research, not to mention a flat rate of $24.95, they presented me with a fifteen-page report, containing 8,000 words and four charts. Never one for reading, I leafed through it carelessly and came upon one single line that I think sums it all up perfectly.   Your blog, unlike Explosive Mandolin, has no zany, random chat excerpts.   Well, if it's excerpts the people want, it's excerpts they get!  RenoSix: I need to have a random conversation for my blog, any ideas? Ducktor Schmitty: tuna RenoSix: TUNA  My blog just got 21.2% cooler.        And now, for another installment of THRILLING ADVENTURE CORNER!!!1!.   I just  HAD  to write about this. Thrilling adventure always makes for great content.  Earlier, while laying the smackdown on Don Flemenco for the second time in Punch-Out!!, I saw a little figure wobbling by my mouse. A little figure that turned out to be a small roach. Now, we don't get many roaches here. In fact, I've only killed one or two. It wasn't a hollywood cockroach, but a little one that resembled a beetle. They come around every now and then to harass me. I'm sure your house has them somewhere, too. Creepy, huh? Anyway.  I told Mewd about it. He stuck beside me on my quest to find the little turd and maim it. I couldn't find it -- exposure to the light caused it to fritter away at a lightning-fast speed, and when I chased it down with my intense, heavy-duty flashlight beam, it took cover off the computer desk.  I vowed to kill it before the night was up.  Well, just now I was admiring my new blog layout and name, I caught out of the corner of my eye, a little figure crawling up the lamp stand. I muttered a few unkind words, spun around, grabbed the flyswatter, and did another 180 turn to the lamp. It was out of sight, on the other side of the pole. So I struck the lamp to catch the little creep's attention. It frittered around, completely unaware that I'm right handed and I had a perfect swing range. I brought down the flyswatter on that waste of life and drew the flyswatter back victoriously. I think it fell down into my fan and got diced by the blades.  Flippin' insect's got nothin' on me.                               I'm going to keep this simple: Jessie and her family need your prayers. Thank you.                                Current  Song:  Video thinger: Weird Al interviewing Eminem   And now, a dramatic reenactment. Playing the part of Eminem, El Ravager. Playing the part of Weird Al, Reno.   ElRavager5: I don't see how you can't not be a fan, ya know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: *smiles and nods* Yes, I know what you're saying. ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: I know what you're saying. ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: Yes, yes, I know what you're saying. ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: ...Yes. I know what you're saying. ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: YES. I know what you're saying! ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: YES! I KNOW! I know what you're saying! ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: YES! ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: YES! ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: YEEEEEEEES!!! ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUUUUUT UUUUUUUUUUUP!!!!!! ElRavager5: Whatever, man.  There is absolutely nothing new tonight. Well, except the obvious: Rav found, and linked me to, a download of Weird Al's "interview" with Eminem a year ago. Al is a connoisseur of ripping apart real interviews and adding his own bits in the place of the questions. This makes for the greatest interview of Eminem, ever.  "Well, I've been asking all the questions here, are there any questions you want to ask me?" "Y'know, how many times can you rhyme, 'tearin' me apart, breakin' my heart'?" "Well, let's see. Homer and Bart, medical chart, strawberry tart, served ala carte, back to the start, post-modern art, plastic lawn-dart, missing a part, Humphrey Bogart, lighting a fart, and blue-light specials each day at K-mart. ...Eleven!"  Man, it's hilarious. In fact, it's so funny, you should watch it, too. Right click this link and click "save target as."  urlLink DO IT NOW!  16mb    That's really it for tonight, though. I'm gonna go play QFG4 until 8:30. AM, of course.                                Current Song: "Breathe," Pink Floyd     Breathe. Breathe in the air. Don't be afraid to care.   Why am I posting this? I dunno. I suppose just reading about  urlLink Vivendi firing off 350 employees and, effectively, Sierra , has brought back a sour taste of Chainsaw Monday. Not that I care if Sierra dies, mind you. No, it's already dead. Here's my post at the QFG forum, last chance to see me there so get it while you can:   I'm not that sad if Sierra disappears. Sierra disappeared five years ago. They're not the same anymore and have no value to me. It doesn't matter if Sierra falls off the map; they're not Sierra anymore, just a bunch of suits with a name that commits blasphemy against a proud legacy. It shames me to see the brand on the dozens of mediocre titles they've put out in the past few years.   Though if the forum falls, that IS a pity. I grew up here.   Aaaand I'll just paste in what I told Mewd to end this entry. Screw Sierra. Screw Vivendi. Screw everybody but Blizzard. Feed Blizzard grapes and give them a private harem. But screw Vivendi.                                Current Song: "Stuck in a Closet with Vanna White," Weird Al    I can officially say that it is our anniversary. Yes, it's past midnight, which means it's now June 23rd. I've been with Jessie for a year. I still remember this day a year ago -- how anxious I was, and how we were kept waiting even longer when her mom and brother were over and taking forever to leave. But it's  really  hard to believe that it's already been a year. Still, it's been a very, very happy year, chock full of romantic moments -- like when my ceiling started leaking in the middle of the night while I was playing Gabriel Knight 1. Oh, or how about when she fell asleep while online and I panicked for half an hour when she wouldn't respond to anything I did? And I'll never forget the time I called her at 5:30 in the morning, apologizing for hanging up on her, when we'd actually gotten off the phone an hour and a half earlier. (Okay, well, that was just funny. I will admit.)  Still, though... a year. I love her very much, and am really thankful to have such a wonderful girlfriend. But enough smarm! This is a weblog. There'll be no mushiness here! Let's cleanse your palate with a random chat excerpt.  MW Expert Lud: Then I challenge you to a duel of honor! RenoSix: I'd rather have a dual of puns. It's triple the excitement, and quads of fun. MW Expert Lud: Hmm... I accept your duel. RenoSix: I hope you realize who you're dealing with. My puns have roots in all of Europe, even Tree Lanka. I have branched out all over the world, and have even had my photosynthesis taken with celebritrees. MW Expert Lud: Well, umm... darn... RenoSix: It's okay if you can't defeet me. I toed you that I was quite a phalange. MW Expert Lud: LOL RenoSix: *twirls moustache*  I played through Quest for Glory 3 last night. I haven't played it in years, yet I finished it from start to finish in a sitting. Deathfoot is now in Mordavia, mingling with the townsfolk and listening to Igor's droll graveyard humor. I'm looking forward to finally playing through Quest for Glory 4, after finally  urlLink defeating the numerous timer errors.   It's 5:50. Why am I still awake? Have a good day, and remember: if you're not in Rav's last will and testament, you're not a popular kid.                                Current Song: "Masquerade," Symphony X     First off, apologies to all who did not see me online tonight (last night? I dunno, it is presently 6:30am). I spent six and a half hours on the phone with Jessie tonight (huzzah for 'free nights and weekends'), mostly playing GK3, partly chatting. We decided to ditch our 'competition' and, instead, play the game moreso 'together.' She restored to where I was and we started going through together. Granted, we're now sharing our progress with each other and helping each other out, but this is something we've always wanted to do -- play an adventure game together -- and GK3 gives us a great chance. We're restricting ourselves to only playing while on the phone; I still haven't caught up to her 480pts, but I'm well on my way -- I think we're around 430. Day 2, 5pm - 10pm. It's really getting good, I must say, though awfully creepy. SPOILER:  Man, Prince James' agents being murdered was a huge surprise. Jess and I both have theories about what happened. Jeez, that word really gets around in this game -- theory.  There, no eyes harmed who haven't played the game. Just highlight that huuuuge blank space for things not fit for print.  More cool blank space!  Aside from GK3 and QFG5 (whom I have been neglecting, I'm sorry, Silmaria), I can't say things have been at their hottest lately. I've been reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy a  LOT  lately. I haven't read it in years, and it's really great stuff. I'm already halfway through the first book in the trilogy (note: yes, Jessie, a trilogy *can* have five books. You're just anal, that's all.) and it hasn't slowed down yet. I'm rather enjoying the book -- and why shouldn't I? It's the Hitchhiker's Guide!  I  have  been in the midst of a problem. A crisis of sorts if you want to get melodramatic. I spoke with Rav about it... two nights ago was it? I don't remember, these summer days are a blur. Anyway, this has really suddenly sprung up, and I don't like it. It's an old fear of mine, really, and it's been stuck on me for as long as I can remember. (I'm not stalling or setting up for some big comedic joke, just giving you some backstory. Like you care.) I've always been afraid of turning eighteen; not because that's when I 'start' on my life or because I go out on my own or because of college or anything like that. I must admit, to all of you who I've mentioned my fears of getting older -- I've been feeding you a white lie this whole time. No, the real reason I'm so anxious and restless about turning eighteen, despite it being nine months away, is because I've always had a fear, a phobia if you will, of being drafted into the Army. Silly, isn't it? That's what I've convinced myself, but I'm afraid that with our recent war thing and all, by April of '05 they'll be needing to recruit more soldiers and thus, will delve into America's lazy, Gen-X youth.  I know, it's a very silly thing to worry over, as there hasn't been a draft for a long, long time. It's just that, well, I've always had a feeling that by the time I turn eighteen they'll be in a war and in need of more support. Jessie insists that I have nothing to worry about, and Rav doubts I need to be concerned. The rest of you I've been silent about my problem to, either because you won't care or because I don't want to bugger you with my petty worries because I've thrown my burdens onto you one-too-many times (this only applies to one of you and  urlLink you know who you are ). I just... I really don't know. I don't know what to make of my worries. The one thing I've been dreading more than anything all of my life is conscription into the military. I mean it. If it wasn't for that, I'd be perfectly secure in my future. To be honest, though? I think this is God's way of convincing me that I need to attend college.  I've shrugged it off with many, many petty excuses -- I don't need it. I can't afford it. I can live without it. I don't want to go to school for another four years. Every time I make one of these stupid, insignificant excuses, I cringe and realize that I'm stalling. God knows this. He knows my problems and struggles. He's also guiding me through them. I have no excuse against college anymore, and I know it. I'm no longer going to reply "College? Nah." It's college all the way for me. I really do need it, despite my reluctance, and it'll excuse me from being drafted. I don't know if I'll be able to afford it, but there are grants and student loans. God'll protect me. I know it. Why should I have any reason to fear? Really, why? The hand of God is covering me and shielding me; His gift of everlasting love, peace and grace is plentiful and mine for the taking, so why should I hold back? It's like the old hymn; "What a friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and grieves to bear..."  Anyway, I don't want to get overly zealous here -- and I have some reading to do. All of you, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Pray for my peace. The more I write and think about my discussion with Jessie over the topic, the more rest and ease I feel. How great God is.                              I dropped a Skittle before. My cat kept intercepting my hand when I tried to pick it up. I eventually saved it though, so don't worry.                                Current Song: "I Believe," Diamond Rio    There's some recent confusion over whether or not I am really me. These rumors are false and must be put to rest! I can't have the general public believing that I am not, in fact, really Ric Carnahan as I claim to be. Imagine the controversy! Imagine the slanderous political mud-slinging movies! I don't need "Celcius 4/8" riding my coat tails. I am here to dispell these crazy myths.   urlLink AMAZING PROOF TO CONTRADICT YOU AND YOUR SILLY RUMORS. GO HOME.   Now that that's settled, on to more pressing business. I had chicken parmesian tonight. It was really good. But the parmesian tasted a little like cheese. I didn't like that. Actually, the food wasn't that good. I wanted my money back, but I just got a rolling pin across the back of my head with a shouting, shrieking voice yelling "THIS IS ALL j00 WILL GET!! LOSER!!" Yeah, sometimes my mom is mean like that.  Oh! The little voice in the back of my head just reminded me NOT to forget this time:  4pm - 6pm in GK3! * Hoozah! Hoozah on highest! I will solve the mystery! The mystery of... of the mystery of the GK3!  Also, I lied about that Hamlet thing, Shakespeare didn't write that. I couldn't sleep last night because I was so sad that I lied to you. I'm sorry.   *I just realized while proofreading this entry after posting it (I like my blog to be done professionally, I actually released about 4 patches for "WOW! Another triple negative!" but you didn't see them because they were  invisible ) that I made a really funny joke. I said "NOT to forget this time:" and I meant, not to forget on this occasion, but I said "NOT to forget this time:" and then listed a TIME, and that made it look like I was saying that I wasn't going to forget the time I put down. Hoo that was funny. I think we've all become a better person after I made such a wily joke.                               I'm on Day 1, 2pm - 4pm in Gabriel Knight 3!  WOO! YEAAAAH!  GO SPORTS!!                                  Current Song:  urlLink "F!$# You Very Much," Eric Idle      Do not click that link if you're easily offended. Should you be, in fact, easily offended and you click that link, your head will explode. You heard me, it will blow clean off.    Really.    -~-   It's 7:05. I've been up all night talking to Rav. And now, I have a headache. Thanks, Rav. I'm going to tell everybody that El Ravager gives headaches for free. Heck, then when you start charging for them, it'll be false advertising and the FCC will kill you.  No, seriously, folks, he doesn't give headaches, just stomachaches.  You may have noticed an abundance of references to Rav. This is because it's become a disturbing trend for him and me to stay awake until around 7 my time (4 his time, mwahaha, I just gave away that you really live in Australia, bet you're mad now) talking about random things. Go complain to him that your regular blog content has been made 5% more interesting. I know you all expect bores by the bushel, but as long as I have a friend, I will not give you the bore you desire! I shall not! I swear it! And I mean it!  Okay! Okay!

Current Song: "Valley of the Damned," Dragonforce    Well, blogheads, things haven't been at their height lately. I was going strong with rapid updates for a while, but I've sorta dropped off the map for a few days. Why? Read on and find out.  First, I should probably explain my last entry -- things are really hectic with Jessie. I won't go into details out of respect for her and her family, but, well, let's put it this way -- her grandma, after some really unfortunate consequences, is barely hanging on to life. She was bleeding internally, and, while she was given a month, she's barely lasted a few days after they discovered it. Jessie's been really strong, though, and I'm proud of her.  This has caused quite a bit of unrest and grief -- so much that progress on Sandwich Quest has halted temporarily. Well, I can't pin it all on the morbid situation in Indiana -- Mewd's been having some awful connection problems and I went onto a Quest for Glory kick the night I mentioned beating QFG3. I beat QFG4 the other night, though, for the first time ever, and am now on QFG5. Deathfoot the Wizard is on the third Rite of Rulership, and has plans to defeat the vile Hydra once and for all! Or not.  Also: I started up Gabriel Knight 3 the other night, and have since been juggling between Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned and Dragon Fire. Man, GK3 is one tough adventure game. For all you sports fans keeping tabs at home (read: 0), I'm on Day 1, 12pm - 2pm. I was stuck for a couple nights (mornings? What a schedule) in the first time block, but I  finally  managed to trigger the next one. I'm having a good time, though. GK3 isn't nearly as bad as I expected gameplay-wise. The camera gimmick takes some getting used to, but it works very well. I'm content with it, and having a blast. It's really amazing the amount of true history that Jane Jensen incorporated into the game; I never thought France could be so interesting. And it's even moreso intriguing that Rennes le Chateau is a real place. And I'll admit, Tim Curry isn't too bad as Gabriel... but  Dean Erickson is still the real Gabriel Knight.  I insist on it. Mewd, Rav, you can say what you want.  By the way, check this out:  urlLink Andy Kaufman Returns   This fellow imitates Andy Kaufman for a big elaborate hoax stating that he's really alive and never died of cancer. It's obviously a hoax, isn't it? I'm glad we agree. Now click on the "Comments" link under any of the posts and take a look at how  unbelieveably gullible  people are. I mean, just when I thought my fellow man had reached the bottom of the barrel with rap music, they go and pull this on me. I'm ashamed to be human.  My closing thought: I'll never be able to ride the Millennium Force at Cedar Point. I'm too tall. Seriously. The seatbelts were designed for dwarves or something, because people over 6'2", I think, won't fit under the restraints. Pity. Oh well -- not like I intend on going outside any time soon anyway.  I'm off to make a triumphant return into Rennes le Chateau. Later, potater.  Epic metal rules!                                 Current Song: "Theme from Spy Hard," Weird Al    It's 7:40am. Remember that bit about having to wake up at 8:30? I actually just woke up an hour earlier. That is how awesome I am.  Haha, just kidding! Funny joke. Actually,  I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A SPORK-LOVING HOUR OF SLEEP!  Bah! Bah bah bah! I finally settled down into bed around 1 or so after talking to Jessie for a while and packing up my stuff. I had my dog with me, and around 1:20, I fell asleep.  At 2, I woke up. I was burning up (why did I put on a blanket with furface lying against my legs and no fan on? Gee I'm dumb) and had a stomachache. A removal of all things blankety and a quick trip into the bathroom relieved my troubles, so I settled back onto the mattress. At around 4, I had enough of lying around and got some apple pie. I ate, drank, and got back into bed. Nothing. Finally, around 5:30, I drifted for about twenty minutes (I don't remember what episode of Cheers it was, so I must've slept), then woke up. I turned off the TV after Nick at Nite went off the air and decided to try listening to my GK3 soundtrack to calm my nerves.  I got through it one and a half times before deciding that enough was enough. I got up, thoroughly angry, and plopped onto the couch. It was there on the couch, with cat cuddled to my chest, that I decided: I'm going to call Dad at about 8 and ask him to pick me up at 12 instead of 9. I need the sleep, man... I NEED THE SLEEP! Holy crap, I am so out of it, but I have insomnia! I have flippin' insomnia! I am extremely tired. I can feel myself flop down into any chair, bed, or couch I sit in. I'm barely aware of what I'm doing. I don't know what to do! I tried everything. I mean, EVERYTHING. I even counted sheep. You heard me -- I counted sheep. As a testament to how tired and barely focused I am, I went from 59 to 100 before realizing that I accidentally gave 60 a miss, then later on, counted from one hundred twenty-nine to one hundred twenty-ten. Come on, look at me! I'm a mess!  But I can't sleep!    urlLink Curse you, Neptune!   Blarg. I'm going to play TimeSplitters 2 while I wait for mom to come home so I can call Dad. I need sleep. I need it baaaad. Hmm, I also need breakfast. Maybe I'll get some.                                Current Song: Gabriel Knight 3 soundtrack    Yeah, finished GK3 the other night (July 7). Jessie and I both played to completion together, from 480 points to the bitter end. Not in one night, mind you, but it wasn't until around 480 that we decided to team up and tackle it together rather than compete. The game was VERY good, though frustrating often. There were a couple of creepy parts --  like exploring Montreaux's attic, and seeing Mallory and McDoogal slain on the rocks, not to mention seeing those visions and the pools of blood by every murder scene  -- but you know, overall, the game wasn't so bad. I'd say that GK2 probably creeped me out more, maybe because of the fact that FMV gaming lends to realism. But I have to say,  Le Serpent Rouge is incredible.  Man, I feel bad for all you people avoiding the spoilers because you can't play the game. You must think there's something really, really interesting in there, but you can't bear to highlight the text and read it! By the way,  this isn't actually a spoiler, but I feel like being a jerk.  Wasn't that part GREAT!? I totally didn't see it coming!  Yes, yes. Enough on GK3. I actually started writing this post an hour ago, but then I started to get sidetracked reading  urlLink How Much is Inside  at  urlLink Cockeyed.com . Great, great website. It looks like the inspiration from another old favorite of mine,  urlLink AllTooFlat . Pick one and go to it. No, in fact, go to both! You owe it to yourself to  at least  check out ATF's Lion and Crossing Man pranks, and Cockeyed's Paparazzi halloween costume. Science geeks can be fun!  Startlingly bad transition from humorous to serious topics!: Jessie's grandmother passed away on July 3rd. This afternoon marked the funeral. Thanks to all my blog readers, gullible as you are for actually buying into this whole "Ric's life" thing, that prayed for her and remembered her family. She appreciates it very much. I would say more, but as before, I'll keep it at that out of respect.  So I'm going to dad's house tomorrow morning. This is not good. I love my dad and enjoy visiting, but...  I have to get up at 8:30.  What am I, insane? 8:30? No, no, completely true. It sucketh. BUT! I can manage. By the time I get home on Sunday, Rav's package, chock full of all the Weird Al CDs I could ever want, will have arrived, and I'll be basking in the glory of CDs-I-currently-only-have-on-cassette. Man, cassette sucks. This is especially for you, cassette nerds: your medium sucks! Aahahaha! L0sers! LOL n00bs!  Also -- "Weird Al" Yankovic - The Ultimate Video Collection rocks. This is all I can say about such a breathtaking masterpiece of stereophonic sound spectacular.  Anyway, before I go and end this blog entry, a crime scene revealed its ugly head the other day and I need your help in discovering the hideout of the perp. I was here at the computer, minding my own business, when I looked over, and, well... it's gruesome, but... here's what I saw.       If anybody has any ideas as to the whereabouts of this vicious killer knife, Henry the Hellbleeder, please disclose all tips and tricks to me. Murderers of innocent aluminum must be stopped!   Isn't that little supernova flashy effect on the blade cool? I did that myself.                                 Current Song: "Awakenings," Symphony X    I could have SWORN I just heard Dr. Phil tell a lady "With great power comes great responsibility." Now where have I heard that before?                                Current Song: "Mr. Popeil," Weird Al      And now, for another installment of THRILLING ADVENTURE CORNER!!!1!.   I was lying in bed last night (this morning?) when I realized that I hadn't written about this in my last post, so I have to do it now. So I was on the phone with The Rav last night when I glanced over and saw a roach climbing the privacy curtain on my door. He was of a good size, and ON MY FRICKIN' DOOR.  Now, naturally, when I see one of these buggers, I tend to shoot my glance around my immediate area to find something that suits the slaughter. I was about to grab my mouse's wrist pad to crush him, but then I saw him: Henry the Hell-Bleeder.  Despite his controversy in the vicious murder of those Mountain Dew cans, Henry's not a bad guy. Sure, he tends to be dangerous, and, actually, quite sharp, but he's used his amazing superpowers for good before. In fact, a nice example of this is last night. Funny story: I actually had to pull the impaled can off of his blade because it had been on there ever since snapping the photo. Okay, it wasn't that funny.  So I grab Henry, explaining to Rav the direness of my situation. Then, wielding Henry in my right hand, I slashed at the beast. Several times. Let me tell you, I put medieval knights to shame. Actually, I think it's more like: I give medieval knights shame. I missed. Many times. In fact, I think the roach was more afraid of the thunderous crash of steel on door rather than the impending doom of a sharpened blade swinging above its doomed person. It scampered about worriedly, always in the opposite direction of the last place I lowered the knife. Finally, the shockwaves dislodged it from the curtain and the creep fell to the floor. Mr. Rav witnessed my cunning fumbling tendancies with a sharp object as I sliced time after time at the roach, eventually crippling it. Henry tasted blood as he made a nice, clean laceration through the center of the bug. It was quite a sight.  Of course, the insect was still wriggling, and now it was on the toe of one of my slippers. I didn't want it to get away. It had already almost scampered to safety upon plummeting to the ground, and I wasn't about to mark this down as a missed opportunity to actually kill something with my dagger. So rather than swipe and slash blindly and risk ruining my slipper, I angled the blade and smushed that sucker with the side. Let me tell you, I've never been happier to see roach entrails. Henry was victorious! Viva la revolucion!                                 Current Song: "Gotta Boogie," Weird Al    Technical date: 7/13 Renoish date: 7/12  Hey, sports fans, welcome to the weblog. Today's been a solidly awesome day. You know how I can prove this? When I woke up, there was a cold Coke in the fridge. You know how long it's been since I've had a real Coke? Nearly two months. I had one at my rich uncle's house, but oddly -- and I'm not exaggerating -- the Coke they have there always, ALWAYS tastes Diet. I think it has to do with the fact that he has more money than humanly necessary. You know how I can prove THIS? He has eleven bathrooms.  If I'm exaggerating, it's only barely.  So after inhaling the Excellent Soda Coke (Double Fine fans, accept this generous injoke), I went on to enjoy a way-cool day. You heard me -- way-cool. I phoned up my buddy Rav and proceeded to make his ears bleed for five hours. That was a lot of fun. I've never, EVER taken part of that many Weird Al references via voice. Heck, I think our back and forth reference-battling has even toppled our online reference-battling. Ah, well, what can I say? I'm just Such a Groovy Guy. If you don't agree with me, tough -- Everything You Know Is Wrong. I would stop my incessant referecing, but why should I stop now? Look, I'll Be Mellow When I'm Dead. Maybe I'm just a Couch Potato, but you can stop me by watching The Brady Bunch. Come on, I Can't Watch This! It saddens me that they even bothered putting it on Cable TV, let alone let the entire block watch it on Frank's 2000" TV. For what it's worth, maybe I'm just Addicted to Spuds, but that's what happens when you're Young, Dumb and Ugly -- you tend to Dare to be Stupid and use Ebay even more than Eddie Vedder. Oh crap, Why Does This Always Happen to Me? I'm on a tangent. I'd better stop before I start talking about how It's All About the Pentiums.  El Ravager now hates me.   And this is at 8:30 in the morning!   (By the way, speaking of, my visit with Dad went just dandily. I called, left a message on his voice mail, then held my breath as I waited for his return phone call. He ended up returning at noon, just as I requested -- I then went and fixed his computer, then spent a wonderfully listless night trying to sleep on the couch, waking up every hour to another rerun of Full House. But his computer is mostly fixed! It still freezes horribly, sadly, but I worked around this problem by installing  urlLink Mozilla Firefox  on his computer instead of Internet Explorer. Seems there's a bug in IE or something that's causing a huge conflict with his computer, because when I cut off its circulation, freezing was no longer an issue. Oh well, Firefox rules anyway. But other than that, everything's awesome and spiffy on his PC. Sucky thing. Don't buy anything from Hewlett Packard unless it's a printer.)                              MysticalDreams83 (3:57:45 AM): I think I might go to bed... ElRavager5 (3:57:09 AM): I hate to bail so early, but I think I'm going to go to bed. Being tired, an' all that... Mewd6 (3:57:52 AM): And now I sleep.  Separate people.  Separate IMs.  What the crap.  (Despite having stuff to talk about, I'm dodging it this post. Why? BECAUSE I CAN! Neener neener!)                                Current Song: "I Hate Everything," George Strait    Got office chair?  urlLink I sure do.   So Blogger has this new WYSIWYG bit. I don't know how much I like it. I mean, it's actually really great, because it allows for people without much experience to edit their weblog without needing to know HTML (read: wimps). But I demand hardcode-ability! I'm an HTML veteran, I don't need these easy versions. I type out my code by hand! I'm a MAN! Woof! Grrr!  Right. Lessee, I should probably tell you that last week I went to my Uncle's house for two nights and had a blast. Wings and steak by day, movies and popcorn by night. Watched the western  Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia  Thursday night and  Rocky IV  Friday night. Both really good movies. (Great, my dog just got up and tossed her cookies for no apparent reason. And we're out of paper towels.) Other'n that, we had a lot of fun. Lots of good conversation, and I managed to fix all their computer problems for them. I r00lz.  Man, I wish we had some paper towels.  Hmm, let's see, other than that... oh, we went to the library the other day. That was great. I picked up a whole lotta cool stuff. *'s next to things I needed for research for my newest novel (i.e. it was either a book on the 40's or a film noir).   Books:    The Age of Doubt: American Thought and Culture in the 1940's*      DVDs:    The Man Who Wasn't There*   The Third Man*   Monty Python's Life of Brian   Big Trouble   Office Space      VHS:    Touch of Evil*   The Big Sleep*   Detour*   Monty Python's Flying Circus vol3     Exciting, huh?! Yeah, I know, you're thrilled. The story's doing well, of course, though I need to finish up the plot. It'll probably be set around 1948... good old fashioned film noir detective story. No, not a Sherlock Holmes-esque bit, I'm talking  film noir.  Black film. Struggling private eyes, seductive femme fatales, crooked cops, shady characters, underhanded criminals,  blackmail  whitefemale*, betrayal, disguise, and deceit -- the works, baby. Best kind of movie out there if you ask me. A rainy night, a down-on-his-luck private dick, a damsel with a request, a twisted world where nothing is what you think it is... ohhh yeah, my kind of story. It's a thrill to be writing one of these.  By the way, I've only watched The Man Who Wasn't There and The Third Man since my trip to the library on Wednesday. The Third Man is a classic noir -- wonderful, wonderful story and dialogue and whatnot. I'd seen it before, and so I knew what to expect, but the DVD was remastered and all that and presented a brilliant reparation of the old film. I wouldn't mind owning that movie, to be honest. The Man Who Wasn't There was disappointing. I mean, it was a great movie, but some of Billy Bob Thornton's acting was overdone (he was supposed to play a quiet barber, but he played a TOO quiet, wooden barber), and a few sequences were rushed. Awesome twist at the end, though. This movie was the perfect example of the essence of noir: a sneaky proposition, a risky chance, and from there, a downhill mudslide. I felt very bad for Ed Crane: he only wanted an escape from the mundane, but a few baaad decisions made his life turn upside down and then fed it to a kraken. Like I said, it's really a great movie and I have nothing against it -- but I was expecting a lot more than what was presented to me. My expectations WERE rather high, though.  Anyhow, I'm off now. Mewd is typing something, and I don't know what it is. Wait, no, he sent the IM. Nevermind. G'night, folks! Don't go jumping into any spider webs or getting your limbs deattached by a sneaky government contract.   *Inside joke that you won't understand unless your name backwards is regavar le.
